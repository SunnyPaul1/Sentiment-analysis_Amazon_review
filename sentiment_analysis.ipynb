On the other hand, the tablets aren\\'t coated and are more like chalky chewable tablets in texture, but are intended to be swallowed without crushing them, although the rougher the tablet, the more difficult it is to swallow - not ideal. On the other hand, the packaging and the price are very good maybe look around for others - the D3 Kwizda is of course unbeatable, but also a bit more expensive. For everyone else I see no problem here.\\nI\\'ve been taking the pills for months now. Before I got a cold every 4-8 weeks.

I find that these funds are often not researched enough to find the right dosage. I think more is more here, but I\\'m not sure if that\\'s why I feel more active now.\\nThe product is great..especially because you should always take vitamin d and k2 together\\nVitamin D is a hormone that plays an important role in an incredible number of processes in the body. Bone augmentation is just a small area. A lower vitamin D level is sufficient for this. In order for vitamin D to have more positive effects on health, the level must be higher. Conventional medicine repeatedly makes \"unfortunate\" statements with regard to vitamin D. Please do not let this irritate you and do your own research. A high vitamin D level protects against many diseases and ensures mild courses. I don\\'t know of any doctor who doesn\\'t take vitamin D regularly, especially during the corona pandemic. He just doesn\\'t recommend it to his patients because he shouldn\\'t do it. Healthcare is always about maximizing profits. If patients become less ill with inexpensive vitamin D, That would be bad for everyone in the healthcare system. However, there are courageous doctors and scientists worldwide who were able to prove with studies that those who had extremely low vitamin D levels were the most severely ill and died from corona. The molecular geneticist Dr. Michael Nehls comes to the conclusion: \"Vitamin D would have prevented severe courses and also most deaths\". That\\'s why his book is also called \"Herdgesundheit\". You can take 1,000 or 2,000 units a day, the maximum value mentioned by conventional medicine is 800. But everyone should research that for themselves. In acute cases, you can also take 20,000 units once a week in therapy. However, these capsules are only available on prescription. The higher doses of vitamin D3 + K2 depot capsules are particularly suitable in winter. According to the RKI, 61.5 percent of Germans have a vitamin D deficiency on average over the year. In winter, this value climbs to 84 percent. Because the sun has to be very high so that our body can produce vitamin D itself with the help of the sun\\'s rays, you will have to supplement for most of the year. Stay healthy, swallow vitamin D.\\nEverything was great, gladly again\\nTop\\nI feel like a fish now\\nGood\\nIt\\'s all perfect.

The taste is also neutral and the tablets are easy to take. On the other hand, the dosage recommendation of taking one tablet every 5th day is nonsense. On a sunny summer day, a healthy person takes in up to 15,000 IU. In addition, vitamin D has to be taken daily if it is to do any good at all. So if someone is out in the fresh air a lot and maybe also works, one tablet a day is enough. People who spend their lives in offices need 2 tablets a day. Only at 10,500 I:E per day does an effect become apparent. Of course, you also get vitamin D from food. An average herring, for example, has more than 1000 IU. It is not so easy to overdose on vitamin D, but almost all Central and Northern Europeans are deficient.\\nCombination of D and K vitamin\\nNot necessary in the summer months.

I haven\\'t had any negative experiences with it over time. I couldn\\'t find any side effects, although that probably also depends on the dosage. The tablets are really small and therefore easy to swallow. In addition, they are tasteless.

Will recommend it\\nMy husband bought me these tablets because I was infected with Corona and he wanted to support me with vitamins. After 4-5 I noticed that my sleep disorder that I have had for years has improved a lot and I was doing very well with less sleep. I used to not be able to wake up in the morning, now I\\'m really awake with 7-8 hours of sleep. I am very positively surprised and have therefore recommended it to friends and family.\\nI like it very much\\nHave a low vitamin D level, since taking these capsules it\\'s better.

(You can read about it) I\\'ve been taking the tablets for a number of years, 3 times a week and will continue to do so. Tablets are tasteless.\\nIt is now well known that vitamin K2 is a very important partner of vitamin D. According to D. Rotter (see Dr. Schweikart on the WWW), vitamin K2 activates the proteins formed by vitamin D (e.g. matrix GLA and osteocalcin). Therefore, with increasing vitamin D levels, a vitamin K2 deficiency can occur. More vitamin K2 is used for activation, so that the vitamin K2 pool in the body is exhausted and the important vitamin is no longer available for other processes in the body. It is probably also known that there are different forms of vitamin K2. The best known are MK4 (Menaquinone-4) and MK7 (Menaquinone-7). MK7 is the clearly superior form of vitamin K2. According to D. Rotter, this superiority is particularly evident in the availability: Both forms show almost complete absorption from supplements. However, due to different binding in the blood, the majority of MK4 is excreted after a few hours, while MK7 remains available in the blood for over 72 hours. A comparison would also show that MK4 vitamin K2 only produces a measurable effect in very high doses, while MK7 works even in the smallest amounts. MK7 is even preferable in dietary supplements because it can be obtained from natural sources, while MK4 is always synthetically produced What may be less well known is that MK7 Vitamin K2 exists in different forms called cis and trans isomers. Both forms are chemically identical, but the geometric structure of the two forms differs. The body can only use the trans form of MK7 vitamin K2, since it can only be bound to certain enzymes in the cell membrane in this configuration. Although the cis form is ineffective, numerous vitamin K2 products consist of up to 70% ineffective cis isomers. When purchasing MK7 preparations, care should always be taken to ensure that MK7 is labeled as “all-trans” trans MK7 vitamin K2. Therefore, I am very impressed that a young German start-up (namely nurela) is able to bring MK7 vitamin K2 to the market in all-trans quality at (in my opinion) a very fair price. Even if this is not yet noted on the packaging, the company founder has confirmed to me that that this product is > 99% all-trans MK7 Vitamin K2. This should be noted on the label of the container for future batches. The very positive picture is rounded off by the fact that cheap and at least controversially discussed additives (microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide or similar) are dispensed with. I consider organic flaxseed flour as a filling to be a really good alternative. In conclusion, I can give a clear purchase recommendation without any restrictions. May it benefit.

It only contains 5,000 IU as higher doses are available from pharmacies & prescription, but my GP says this dose is way too low, especially as we have had vitamin D deficiencies on a number of occasions in the past (even in the summer!). He recommended gain at least 2 tablets per week instead of 1 every 5 days and for that they are too expensive for me. Now I get a preparation with 20,000 IU 1x/week for 30 € on prescription for the whole year. PS: Always have vitamin D checked by a doctor! It is toxic if overdosed!\\nit\\'s all ok\\nTasteless\\nSince I have dealt (or had to) deal with D+K2 a lot in the last year, I am very satisfied with these tablets. After a test and a D-value of 20 (normal value is 100-120), my doctor recommended me a corresponding high-dose regimen (20,000 units daily). If you really deal with this vitamin, you will realize what this vitamin does and how important it is for the body and the psyche. It is important, if you have done a high-dose cure (if the value is of course low) and the value is in the normal range, to keep this value (it drops quickly again). Since the units after the cure naturally have to be lower (an excess is also not good), I ordered these tablets. It is recommended to take one tablet once or twice a week, which I think is not enough, since not much vitamin D can be absorbed here in Germany. In the summer it can be enough... I take one tablet a day to keep my level up and prepare myself for the darker days. The only drawback for me is that the tablets are not quite as easy to swallow for me. Otherwise I\\'m satisfied. Everyone should do a D test, even if this is unfortunately not covered by health insurance. that the pills are not quite as easy to swallow for me. Otherwise I\\'m satisfied. Everyone should do a D test, even if this is unfortunately not covered by health insurance. that the pills are not quite as easy to swallow for me. Otherwise I\\'m satisfied.

Since vitamin D is fat-soluble and the absorption from a previous meal is better absorbed, I always took it after breakfast. Dosage I took 1 tablet per day. In the beginning I took several tablets a day for a few days to quickly raise the level. But this is not mandatory, if you take 5000 IU continuously, the level will also adjust over a longer period of time.Price You get 900,000IU per can. At 5,000 IU per day, that\\'s enough for 6 months, so it\\'s very cheap. I actually switched to the D3 + K2 drops from natural elements, because you get almost twice the content for less money here. Even with the tablets, however, it is just €3/month, so it is more a question of the preferred form of administration is if you don\\'t have acute money problems.ResultMy level is 134nmol/l, which corresponds to about 53.6 ng/ml. So I was able to hit the desired mirror optimally. There was hardly any blazing midday sun this summer, so I can reduce the dosage a little if there is a lot of sun. which corresponds to about 53.6 ng/ml.

I researched the internet for a long time and finally decided on this product from the Natural Elements brand.✅ It actually works 😅✅ Easily tolerated✅ Made in Germany✅ Without unwanted additivesThe only thing that surprises me is the recommended dosage... One tablet in 5 days? I weigh about 80 kg and take a tablet (5000 IU) every other day. Only after adjusting the dosage did I notice a significant improvement. I hope my review was able to help you a little ✌️\\nI let them melt in my mouth, they are odorless and almost tasteless, pleasant. I don\\'t notice any effect even after many months of taking vitamin D, but I will continue to take it. Unfortunately, I can\\'t tell if the quality is good judge, I hope so. I take 20,000 IU every day\\nI can\\'t say much about the ingredients and have to trust the information. It is unpleasant when swallowing that the tablet dissolves directly in the mouth. I don\\'t know that from other preparations and I didn\\'t expect it either.\\nSo far I\\'ve tried the item, I think it\\'s pretty good and I recommend it\\n...made easy. Easy to swallow with a small splash of water.\\nThe product is excellent and fast service.\\nAfter a D3 deficit was determined by the doctor, I was able to compensate perfectly with this product. The need may vary from person to person - for me, 1 tablet every other day is just right. That\\'s why I\\'m sticking with it.\\nAfter trying a product from another manufacturer before, I switched to this one because the other product smelled suspiciously of machine oil or something similar. These vitamin D tablets are completely odorless. The tablets are a bit larger than competing products, but I personally have no problems swallowing them. In general, there is nothing to complain about in terms of quality, as far as I can judge. An evaluation of the ingredients is of course difficult to accomplish without commissioning a laboratory. When it comes to food supplements, one should probably listen to the relevant tips such as \\'sold for a long time\\' and \\'established manufacturer with their own website\\' and, in particular, pay attention to critical reviews. All this is given with the vitamin D product from Natural elements, so that the provider at least meets the basic requirements. As for the dosage, it must be said that the manufacturer adheres to the legal recommendations (and restrictions on dietary supplements), which is why he recommends 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 every five days. Personally, I go beyond this and generally take one tablet per day, in times of Corona to strengthen the immune-modulating effect of vitamin D3 even 2 tablets, i.e. 10,000 IU per day. According to the American Endocrinological Society, this dose is safe for healthy adults (see the website of the Bremen Health Department about vitamin D). I would like to emphasize that this is not a recommendation, but simply reflects my personal considerations. that the manufacturer adheres to the legal recommendations (and restrictions on dietary supplements), which is why he recommends 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 every five days.

I can see immediately whether a product is working on my skin (in summer I have the most beautiful, healthy skin and as soon as autumn/winter comes I tend to have crumble cakes). With good vitamin D tablets, however, this improves considerably. So I can say that I am satisfied with the effect so far. The packaging isn\\'t bad either. The box is surprisingly small, but I don\\'t think that\\'s a bad thing. I\\'m deducting a star for consistency though. With the previous preparation I had capsules, which were also easy to swallow. Unfortunately, the small tablets dissolve very quickly. Both in water/juice in the mouth and on the tongue alone. This gives off a somewhat unpleasant feeling/taste in the mouth. Otherwise a great product for a good price.\\nSince I was severely vitamin D deficient, I tried these pills. I had a dosing formula from a textbook. After 3 months, a new blood count showed that my vitamin D level is now at the upper limit of the target value, which corresponds exactly to the formula for the dosage. Therefore, I can say that the pills really work as stated. Unfortunately, the vitamin In my case, D mirror did not bring any improvement in the symptoms, but it is definitely good for health (bones) if the value is within the target range. So I will continue to take the pills.\\nEverything went well except for one small thing. I had often ordered exactly these D3/K2 tablets for us and also for my brother. The last ones ordered always contained 180 tablets with 72g, which now have 180 tablets 45g in the box and the tablets are also much smaller. The active ingredient should be the same as the values \\u200b\\u200bgiven, but where did they save money. We\\'ve been taking 20,000 units a week for years, our modern doctor too, but he only takes one that he prescribes himself. Haven\\'t been sick for years and no Corona either, we\\'re over 60. We also test our mirror twice a year (spring and autumn) with our doctor, 25 EUR otherwise he won\\'t see us. . Perhaps natural elements will contact us for feedback.\\nSince no body can\\'t get it together to finally get pregnant, I ordered some vitamins. So far all good, easy to swallow. Doesn\\'t smell or taste funny 👌\\nThis vitamin supplement helped me a lot through the dark season this year. Even if it takes a few days until a noticeable effect occurs, this should not be underestimated. The result for me was a more positive and active mood. However, it is not a panacea for winter depression, it also requires a basic attitude towards more positive thoughts and feelings. In severe cases, professional help should also be sought.\\nVery cheap and effective\\nSince I\\'ve been a \"fan\" of Vit3 and K2 for a long time, I\\'m glad to have found this product. My VitD3 stores have to be replenished at least twice a year (blood test in advance, of course, by the doctor). Take a high dose of 20,000 IU per tablet per week and then 20,000 IU per tablet 1-2 times a week for a period of 3 months. conn. only once. per tablet 20,000 iU. K2 in drop form was also taken. Since I only had tablets with 20,000 iU and wanted a lower dose for the following months, I have now found this product and am satisfied with 1 tablet per 5,000 iU Top. And it works: since taking D3/K2 the constant tiredness has disappeared. I feel fitter and even my mood is better. Great side effect:\\nSince pure vitamin D supplementation improves calcium absorption without vitamin K2 harboring the risk of calcification, I was looking for a product that combined both active ingredients in one tablet. I actually found what I was looking for here! With 5,000 IU of vitamin D, I think that as a personal trainer & nutritionist, you are well served and the use of MK7, whose half-life is a lot higher than the often used MK4, rounds off the combination. The tablets themselves are very small and easy to swallow. However, since these are fat-soluble vitamins but \"only\" compressed into a pill, I recommend taking vitamin D with a source of fat to improve absorption. So directly when eating or with a bit of oil.\\nBrings the blood picture back to normal with the vitamin values.\\nThe combination of vitamin D3/K2 is optimally balanced. Perhaps one should add the note that vitamin D3 should be taken with some oil as it is oil soluble.\\ngreat\\nCan you recommend\\nFast deliverySmall easy to swallow dropsEverything as described!\\nOk, I have to admit that I change the dosage a bit and dose higher than recommended, but this makes me feel much better personally.

I will buy again!\\neverything OK.\\nAfter blood tests repeatedly noticed a (significantly) too low level over a period of months, I got these tablets. A few weeks later everything was back to normal, so it seems to be working fine. The tablets are best taken with fatty food, as Vit D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin. I dosed with 3 tablets per week, which is higher than the information on the package, but far from values \\u200b\\u200bwhere you would have to worry. Of course, more sunlight is better, but if that is not so easy to set up, you can use this help well :)\\nSmooth pills with no annoying taste, easy to swallow.Vitamin D is a must in our latitudes. However, it is only properly absorbed by the body with vitamin K. So this combination product is the optimal solution. As always, the right dosage ensures optimal success. So talk to your doctor about using these over-the-counter pills.\\nSince I\\'ve been using this product, I\\'ve felt very well in the winter because it\\'s very well dosed 5000 iE. I can only highly recommend it because D3 is indispensable in winter. Most doctors have no idea about vitamins, that\\'s my tiresome experience. The shop delivers on time and the goods arrive well packaged. So I recommend everyone to get a good D3 level you should build up 400,000 units for the first time, which means 10 capsules a day for the first 8 days and then one capsule every 2 days so you\\'re on one very good mirror. Sunscreens in summer prevent the absorption of D3 you should be in the sun at least 3 times a day for 15 minutes without sunscreen.\\nWe don\\'t get enough vitamin d, and this supplement is the best\\nWhat more is there to say here. Product has no taste and the pills are small and easy to swallow.when I sit a lot in the office I take one pill a day with rather greasy food and actually feel more energetic.When I spend more time outdoors I have not feeling the need for D3.\\nSince I have been taking vitamin D3 in high doses for a few months due to an originally extremely low vitamin D3 level (Dekristol), I use vitamin K2 MK3 to ensure that the calcium finds its way to where it belongs (--> in hard body regions such as teeth , bones, hair + nails) and is not deposited somewhere in the soft tissue (arteries, heart valves, etc.) and would have an unfavorable effect there in the long term. This vitamin combination seems to me - in addition to exercise and a conscious diet - to be a trustworthy and effective osteoporosis prophylaxis. because the vitamin K2 here is administered in ground flaxseed and not with any unwanted fillers or other supplements that I don\\'t need.I\\'ve been taking the vitamin K2 MK7 capsules daily for a few weeks now, while I\\'ve been taking vitamin D3 20,000 IU weekly.Since I still have I can\\'t compare vitamin K in any dosage form. But I\\'m doing much better (excellent!) than in January 2017, when I was always very tired and in need of rest with normal daily requirements, which I blamed on my age .The vitamin supplements D3 + K2MK7 are obviously very good for me (I often feel more like 45 than 62). If you are looking for more background knowledge about vitamin D3 and K2 MK7, the following reading is also recommended:Dr. medical R. v. heroes,\"\\nDelivery was quick and corresponds to the description. Good service.\\nMHD 06/2023, the product cannot be used up during this period, an MHD 03/2025 is required for this!\\nBut a bit expensive, advantage you only need one tablet\\neverything great\\nIn my opinion, they are the best vitamin K 2 capsules on the market! Update 01/18 I\\'ve been taking the capsules for half a year now and I\\'m thrilled! K 2 is essential in combination with vitamin D, without K 2 you can take as much vitamin D as you do want, it brings you little or nothing! I can only recommend these capsules to everyone, they are very good in my opinion, because they only have one carrier and it is great, flaxseed flour with a proportion of omega 3. Many suppliers have unnecessary fillers. I myself suffer from multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, restless legs syndrome and 3 herniated discs. I take vitamin D every day in combination with K2 and magnesium and I can tell you I\\'m feeling much better. There is no longer any comparison to the times when I was treated with the drug club. If you suffer from osteoporosis or neurological diseases, I can only strongly advise you to take vitamin K 2 / vitamin D and magnesium. If you suffer from cardiovascular diseases, I can only advise you to take vitamin K 2. Vitamin K 2 clears your arteries, it transports the calcium into your bones and they are strengthened. If you have problems with your teeth, K 2 is the solution, 1-2 capsules a day and the pain disappears. For older people, I would strongly recommend vitamin K 2 MK 7 take it, if only as a precaution. But always remember to take vitamin K 2 in the all-trans form. Many providers only offer K 2 in CIS form, so you can throw the capsules in the garbage can right away. The body cannot use the CIS form. Why do I expressly recommend these vitamin K 2 MK 7 capsules from Natural Elements?!1. The capsules do not contain any unnecessary additives such as magnesium stearate, magnesium salts from fatty acids or microcrystalline cellulose.2. The product has a vegetable capsule and not a gelatine capsule like many other suppliers. Of course there are undoubtedly cheaper suppliers, but in most cases you have exactly these additives or are dosed lower. I want to do something good for my body and not swallow all these additives or chemicals because they are stored in my body!Update 04/18I have ordered the K2 capsule again, but I am no longer enthusiastic about the new recipe! A new K2 has now been processed, by a biotech company called Kappa/Oslo. This company synthetically produces the K2, the side effects were severe. Sweating, palpitations, tremors, severe headaches etc... I stopped taking it after 4 days and the side effects were gone. I don\\'t want any pharmacy in my supplements! The proportion of linseed or omega 3 has also fallen drastically. I don\\'t understand Natural Elements at all, what kind of philosophy is that, when I buy nutritional supplements, I want herbal ingredients and no chemicals. The studies on K 2 had all been carried out in herbal form and the effect was phenomenal. I had my blood values \\u200b\\u200bchecked using the old recipe. They were really good!!!! I\\'m personally very disappointed with the new recipe!!!! It has nothing to do with nature!!!! Therefore I can\\'t recommend buying it!! I hope I was able to help you with my explanations.\\nI bought this supplement to have enough vitamin D even in the winter months with little sun. The dietary supplement arrived well packaged, undamaged and, as usual from Amazon Prime, quickly. The box in which the tablets are located corresponds in reality to the preview image. It not only has a very attractive design, but also high-quality workmanship and for this reason stands out from the products of the competition. The tablets are easy to take with a sip of water and do not taste unpleasant. The recommended dose is one tablet every five days. Since K2 is added to vitamin D, it is easier for the body to absorb. In my opinion, the product is easy to use. In addition, I tolerate it very well. For what is offered,\\nGood\\nAfter the supply in many preparations left a lot to be desired, you get a more than adequate supply of the sun vitamin here. At least during the winter months we give the whole family one tablet once a week.\\nJust one pill gives me a lot of energy, but you have to lie on the bed for a while after taking it\\nAlthough the product is quite cheap, the quality and quantity wins out, I will probably buy it again when it is empty.\\nGood compatibility.\\nIt\\'s a little hard to rate a supplement after only a month or two, but I\\'m doing it anyway. It looks serious and I think I\\'m seeing an improvement! I\\'ll definitely be trying more products! Plus, it\\'s among all the K2 vitamins one of the few \\'all trans\\' products! Folks no \\'all trans\\' no effect just profit for the production company!\\n..., for 3 winters not even the smallest cold....\\nNo\\nI bought the tablets because my VIT-D3 level was always insufficient. When the last blood was taken, the level had already risen and that after only 4 weeks of intake. Therefore a clear purchase recommendation for me!\\nGood value for money, good tolerability, easy to swallow, fast delivery, clear purchase recommendation!\\nOK\\nGreat product\\nI was very surprised how small the packaging of the tablets is. The tablets are quite small and easy to swallow. I can\\'t say whether these work after the short time, you probably have to take them for a few weeks. The tablets are tasteless in my opinion.\\nTablets are great, problem is the dosage schedule is once every 5 days.\\nGladly again\\nbomb ;)\\nMy daily companion, especially when there is a lack of sun like in autumn or winter.\\nProduct expires with in a year and 180 tablets uses more than 3 years. So the strategy of the company is to make you buy every year or sell out old stuff first. Poor company.\\nproduct perfect, fast delivery\\nThe dosage given here is far too low and does absolutely nothing. You can leave it there. I personally take 2 tablets per day, that is 10,000. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has derived a tolerable total daily intake of 100 µg (4000 IU) for adults. The American Endocrinological Society even considers an intake of up to 250 µg of vitamin D3 per day (10,000 IU) in healthy adults to be harmless. However, those who take more vitamin D should also take magnesium with this higher vitamin D dose, namely between 200 – 300 mg – depending on the magnesium content of the diet.\\nInexpensive vitamin D preparation with good effectiveness. My vitamin D level was very low. By taking these capsules I am in a very good range. The recommendation is: 1 capsule per week. I would also like to add that this can vary. It is advisable to have the individual Vit D value checked while taking the medication and adjust the dose accordingly, as it was for me. That can mean that you have to or can take more. According to the literature, the vitamin K it contains is also unproblematic in higher doses\\nThey are small, easy-to-swallow tablets with a high dosage. I really like the brand in general. Especially in the winter months I like to take the tablets.\\nmakes me sleep deeply\\nThe time is too short to write much about the effect. I had a heavy coating on the tongue for over a year and it had completely disappeared on the 4th day of taking it. Coating on the tongue stands for stomach/intestines or bronchi, among other things not blood clotting. I measure my INR value weekly with my CoaguChek and my coagulation value remains constant. Since I have only been taking K2 together with high-dose vitamin D3 and magnesium for 12 days, I can only report on my experience at a later date. Right now I\\'m filling up my memory and following the recommendation of Dr. by heroes from the book \"Healthy in 7 Days\". Even if the title reads a bit pompous and implausible, a lot of positive things are happening in the body during this time. von Helden has been very consistent with me. Online test: 21.9 ng/ml Laboratory: 23 ng/ml Update 21.8.2018 I have been taking K2 in conjunction with Vit.D3 and magnesium citrate (pure magnesium) for over 1 year. My triglycerides are at 351 89 gone down. My cholesterol levels and osteoporosis have also improved. I discontinued Marcumar. My laboratory value of D3 is 78 ng/ml. This value is completely sufficient for me. My general well-being has increased.\\nI am very pleased!\\nI bought the 180 tablet box. Everything makes a very good impression and further research shows that this manufacturer is probably one of the very few in Germany that offers an all-trans product. Nevertheless, I wonder what sense the recommended daily dose of 1 tablet/5 days makes . Scientists more or less agree that vitamin D3 is stored in the body for a long time, which is why the amount of 2500% of the daily requirement of D3 makes sense somewhere, but one has to ask why it overshot the mark becomes. Can so much D3 be stored in the body at all so that it has supplies for 5 days? I made a small calculation: 180 tablets x 5 = 900. So the pack lasts 900 days, or almost 2.5 years. According to the specified MHD, the product expires after just under 2 years. You don\\'t have to be a genius to see what I\\'m getting at. For me, this is a very strange property of a product. Maybe there is an explanation from the manufacturer? Would interest me.\\n...the stock goods that are still sold. The background is that the manufacturer switched production to smaller tablets some time ago, which are much easier to swallow and have smaller packaging, but the ingredients are exactly the same (just less filling/carrier material). the article was reduced from 19 to 12€ - however, the \"old\" batch was sold, which means large tablets and a correspondingly shorter expiry date. This is of course not a defect, but an indication that one would like to get rid of the \"old\" tablets for the lower price been nice.\\nMy friend\\'s doctor recommended it to me\\nSince I have psoriasis and suspect that a higher vitamin D level is good for me, I have my blood measured every six months. After taking these pills (one a day) my level has risen as expected. The psoriasis didn\\'t get any worse in the winter either, just a little bit better. That gives hope for the summer. Therefore I can recommend these tablets, but you should know what you are doing. The dosage may be too high for healthy people to take daily.\\nwhat is there to write about this? I trust the brand and hope to have purchased a good product. From the ingredients I think I made a good decision.\\nHave been taking it for years. I used to have low vitamin D levels. According to my doctor, this is now as it should be :-)\\nAll perfect\\nSuper quality, fast delivery, feel very comfortable\\nTook one every day. Every 5 days is not enough. But it\\'s typical. Vitamins shouldn\\'t help, not that we neglect the pharma pharmacies 😉\\nI had automatically assumed that these tablets are to be taken 1 a day. It turns out that they are to be taken once every 5 days - not an easy routine to follow.It is entirely my fault for not reading the details on the website (if it is stated there) but I will not be buying them again.\\nBad vitamin D3 K2 product not tolerable at all malaise shortness of breath headaches for several days unfortunately not recommended at all.\\nEasy to take and good effect. I went from under 40 ng to 52 over a period of about 1/2 year. As with any dietary supplement, the blood values \\u200b\\u200bshould be determined at the beginning and during the intake in order to keep an eye on the current value. Every body absorbs differently, so that no general statement can be made for a remedy. Anyway, I\\'m very happy with it.\\nyou\\'re welcome\\nagainst my joint cracking. I\\'m in the sun a lot but have suffered from extreme cracking in my shoulder, neck and knee since menopause. It was sometimes so bad that I thought I was about to lose a part of my body:-( My sister\\'s tip led me to these pills. My symptoms improved enormously after a short time. My son also takes these pills. He says that \"His mood has improved. However, we take one pill every 2 days. I don\\'t understand why doctors don\\'t point this out. Then I would have taken Vit. D+K long ago.\\nThe tablets are a little harder to swallow even though they are very small. But the most important thing is that I no longer have to take the vitamins in drop form. I had constant problems with my gums because of the drops.\\nI decided to buy this product after doing blood tests because of my vegan diet. For my vit D3, I got a 7 value which is considered very insufficient, so after reading quite a bit about it I was really looking for a 5000iu of vit D3 but after reading a review that says that the intake dosage is one every five days , I went back to the product description and noticed that it does mention it. If I had realized that, I would\\'ve bought a 1000iu of Vit D3 because it\\'s really not very convenient as the days aren\\'t always the same. Most reviews criticized the texture and size, I had no issues with that. They do look like duds or chalk. In a few months I\\'ll be doing another blood test and if my results come out with an improvement, I\\'ll definitely come back and give my positive feedback.\\nThe vitamin K2 is made from fermented soy, which I\\'m really excited about, so it\\'s as natural as possible and without unnecessary extras. And that it works is even better. I take the capsules with vitamin D3 and vitamin A because the three interact and are therefore best taken in this combination. There\\'s an effect (I\\'m assuming) that can\\'t be seen because I can\\'t look into my vessels and there are effects that I can clearly see. Since taking vitamin K2 and the others mentioned, my bleeding gums, which have been chronic for many years, have disappeared within a month. My dental plaque and tartar have also been reduced to a minimum. My skin has become smoother, which is particularly noticeable on the back of my hands and my hair is shinier, fuller and split ends have decreased. My mother also takes the capsules, the age spots on her hands have largely disappeared and her arms are becoming more and more spotless. I can only recommend the capsules, especially from this manufacturer, because they have an effect and because there are few K2 products that are made from natural ingredients.\\nVery good value for money compared to other products. Definitely better than Oleovit drops which don\\'t contain the important K2.\\nI\\'ve been taking these turmeric capsules for a while now. The combination with piperine is important, as otherwise the body cannot process the turmeric. Turmeric is helpful for people with rheumatism who constantly have to take a very low dose of cortisone to keep the inflammation under control. Otherwise the dose would be higher. At the same time, I pay a lot of attention to my diet. CONCLUSION: Turmeric is just one building block in the chain of helpful things for rheumatism sufferers. Everyone has to find out the individual building blocks for themselves, because you don\\'t hear a word from the doctor in this regard. Not even from a rheumatologist.\\nperfect thing\\nSince vitamin D has always helped me so far, I ordered this product here and I have to say that I am really satisfied. The dosage is simply great, so that you don\\'t have to take umpteen capsules a day to get the recommended daily requirement to take and the capsules are easy to swallow. Overall a really good product for a price that I think is absolutely okay.\\nGood vit d. Good dispatch\\nWhat to say about food.

I previously hadn\\'t taken any supplements.\\nUnfortunately, after 3 months of taking the pills, my vitamin D level has dropped by 30%, even though I took a pill every 2-3 days and lay in the sun almost every day.

This value is not yet a defect (deficiency only begins with values \\u200b\\u200bbelow 19), but according to the laboratory (Synlab) the value is suboptimal. The minimum target value is 30.

This is impractical. It is better to take one pill every day. Therefore, I will most likely not buy this product again.\\n5000 IU every 5 days is not enough, I take 10000 IU a day and for six months I no longer know what a cold or flu is. Once a year I have a D3 mirror made, mine is 80Ng and therefore very good .I have the feeling that people shouldn\\'t stay healthy at all.\\nI can\\'t imagine life without it, not just since Corona\\nI was looking for a vegan product myself. This isn\\'t vegan but I think it\\'s good quality. I\\'ve only been taking it for 2 weeks now and I can\\'t see any difference, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not having an effect. I have the manufacturers asked if it was vegan and quickly got a very friendly and competent answer. Summary: The K2 is vegan but the D3 is made from wool fat (lanolin) in a resource-saving manner.\\nI\\'ve only been taking it for a few days. So I can\\'t say much about long-term effects. Essential for strengthening and supplying daily needs. Helps to activate and strengthen the immune system.\\nAs far as I can judge (without a detailed chemical analysis of the product), this product can be recommended without reservation. In terms of price, it is in the upper average for the vitamin K2 products available on Amazon, but as the product description particularly emphasizes, no problematic substances are added here, as is usually the case when pressing tablets. I myself have only just switched to this product because the supplier of the vitamin K2 capsules I had previously ordered switched production to pressed tablets. Another thing to emphasize, because unfortunately not a matter of course, is the long shelf life of the capsules supplied (best before 10/2019 for delivery in 11/2017, i.e. practically twice as long as it takes to use up the pack); some manufacturers regularly deliver goods that expire before you can use up the product alone at the recommended dosage! I therefore give it 5 stars and a clear recommendation for the K2 from nurela.\\nFor the first time I have my D3 blood level correct and only since taking this product.\\nEffect clearly noticeable, especially in winter. Studies have proven its effectiveness, which is why I have been supplementing with D3 regularly in the dark months for years and can expressly recommend this product. Tolerance very good!\\nI\\'ve been taking these tablets daily for about 2 years, even in summer. My vitamin D level was extremely low, I had it measured again a month ago (18 euros). Now super value, internist recommends: continue taking!\\nVitamin K2 is hardly contained, at least in the food available in this country (who consumes kilos of parsley). Vitamin D3, calcium and magnesium are taken by many as quite important additives. Of course you want calcium to be incorporated into the bones or serve the brain; you don\\'t want it to harden your veins. Vitamin K2 (and this is something completely different from K1) allows the calcium to be used properly. A surprising side effect of K2 was that when I take it in the morning it kinda improves my mood as well, although there\\'s no explanation for that at the moment. A year pack is very useful here. The bottle is large and not easily overlooked. It would also work smaller but of course pure tablets would be a little more exposed to oxidation and would certainly degrade faster. K2 is fat soluble, so an almost ideal solution has probably been found here. It would be even better if you could get Japanese natta in the supermarkets.\\nIt\\'s okay. I need them as in winter time I\\'m not able to be in the sun for long so I try to get Vintamin D via tables. Everyone should do that.\\nvery good\\nI even had corona in cairo and it was super mild. I exercise a lot and treat my body vwey well\\nGood\\nI\\'ve been taking it every day for years and haven\\'t been sick in over 16 years. I also didn\\'t mind contact with people who were severely ill with Corona\\nEasy to swallow, the dosage is also good for me, and there is no coating around the tablet, which I also find pleasant only pressed when they crumble (which is not) but then it can still be used 👍\\nI\\'ve really rarely left the house in the last few months and I\\'ve noticed how broken it has made me physically. I took one of these pills a day to replenish my storage and already on the second day I noticed my energy coming back! I\\'m thrilled and will definitely continue to take them during the cold months.\\nJust got the product this week. It\\'s easy to swallow and doesn\\'t really taste like anything. However, I can\\'t say anything about the real effect after such a short time 😊\\nEverything great\\nI can\\'t say anything about the effectiveness of the preparation. The pack contains 180 tablets, the recommended dose is 1 tablet every 5 days. The best before date is 09/23 if purchased in 7/22. By then I hadn\\'t even used half of the pills... Not like that, Natural Elements!\\n... are completely new to me. The delivery was the day after the order, thanks to Prime. The glass containers were very shatterproof and professionally packed. The products are virtually tasteless and I can get them down very easily. All in all I can\\'t say anything negative so far. I assume that there will definitely be a follow-up order from my side.\\nMy 2nd can, I don\\'t know if they\\'ll do anything, they\\'re not high doses like the ones you get prescribed by your family doctor. I feel fitter and more alert.\\nI buy all my supplements from this company and I\\'m satisfied. Whether it helps I hope so, but in moderation it can\\'t hurt.\\nUse it as a dietary supplement for my training. The pills are actually very easy to swallow and have a standard size. It is important to mention here that you only take one every five days, as they are stored by the body!\\nI take the capsules for prevention. I came across this product when I was looking for Vitamin K2 MK7 All trans.\"In general, Vitamin K2 MK7 is currently considered the most effective form of vitamin K2, as it has the highest bioavailability, circulates in the blood the longest and thus has the most lasting effect. However caution is advised here: MK7 also exists again in two different forms, which are referred to as cis and trans isomers. These forms are chemically identical and differ only in the geometric structure of the molecule. In practice, this unfortunately makes a lot big difference, since the body can only recognize and utilize the trans isomers. Vitamin K2 MK7 in the cis form is therefore almost completely ineffective.\"The capsules are easy to swallow and have no side effects for me.\\nI\\'ve been buying the K2 mk7 from natural elements for two years now, and I\\'ve also recommended this product to many friends and acquaintances because the price-performance ratio was really very good. When I first bought it, I paid €18.99 for the annual pack, shortly thereafter on June 22, 2017 the price had risen to €20.90. On February 19, 2018 I ordered again, this time for €26.99! Today, on March 31, 2018, I actually wanted to order another annual pack for my sister. I thought I\\'d be hit! The K2mk7 from natural elements costs €34.99 today. How can it be that one and the same product has become 84% more expensive in a very short time??? What kind of company philosophy is that? ?Since so many people have now bought this product and given positive feedback, should it actually be cheaper???If it becomes more expensive again in the near future, I will look around for alternatives, which I would really regret!!!I think it is time for the company take a stand on this! Neither the raw materials nor the production can get that expensive in this short time!!! This has nothing to do with the good quality, there is no question about it!!! That\\'s why I recommended it to dozens of people with a clear conscience!!! I give it 5 stars in terms of quality, but because of the price policy I\\'ve already described, I\\'m deducting 2 out of 5 stars now. Pity :-(( Neither the raw materials nor the production can get that expensive in this short time!!! This has nothing to do with the good quality, there is no question about it!!! That\\'s why I recommended it to dozens of people with a clear conscience!!!

Pity :-((\\neverything great.\\nI used another vitamin K2 product in the past, which I could not be sure (due to missing information or unanswered inquiries to the manufacturing company) that it was MK7 all-trans. NURELA, on the other hand, clearly states that the product is made from NATTO and that the capsules contain MK7 all-trans. This information is of crucial, even vital importance, since with high doses of vitamin D3 it is essential to take this form of MK7 in order to prevent calcium deposits in the arteries avoid. The other form of MK7 (cis form), according to a study by Dr. Schweikart or David Rotter (enter both names in Google search to get to the website!) are completely ineffective and therefore in the long term there is a risk of a heart attack or stroke. Amazing side effect: I also had severe insomnia for years. With the daily intake of 4 capsules of vitamin K2, these are a thing of the past.\\nSo far I am completely satisfied with the product. It is tasteless and the tablets are small and easy to swallow. Of course I have to wait for the effect first, but I think it\\'s good because of the high dosage that I only have to take the tablets every 5 days and not every day.\\nAfter a week I can\\'t say exactly how well the tablets are doing pos. have an effect on my body but they are easy to swallow and do not smell unpleasant. The packaging is fine and the quantity is also sufficient, since only one tablet has to be taken every 5 days.\\nDo the job. And it is easy to swallow but kind of rusty flavor.\\nI\\'m constantly trying new supplements and I have to say that so far none of them have had any noticeable effects on me - except for this one. However, positive effects (I felt more balanced, more relaxed and happier) only occurred after taking one pill a day and I think you have to also keep the D3 level high because taking breaks quickly causes any effect to fizzle out.\\nGood product, fast delivery\\nGood value and excellent product.\\nSince I\\'ve been tired all the time for a few weeks and I have a vitamin D deficiency, my work colleague recommended the tablets to me. For about 2 weeks I\\'ve been taking the tablets, but not one every 5 days but 1 every 3 days. Unfortunately I haven\\'t noticed any improvement so far. Of course, I don\\'t know if it\\'s too early to find out. I took 1 tablet on Sunday morning and went to the doctor the next Monday morning to test my blood levels. When I was back at the doctor\\'s on Monday evening, she told me that my vitamin D was right in the basement. That\\'s why she immediately prescribed vitamin D soft capsules from Dekristol 20000 and I should first take 3 tablets a week for 3 weeks and then again for blood checks. My opinion is,\\nThe ingredients probably keep what they promise, but I was slightly surprised by the small amount. Even if the tablets are only to be taken every 4-5 days, other manufacturers offer more for the price...\\nEverything is great, keeps what it is and promises. You can feel it after a relatively short time.\\nI\\'ve been taking the tablets together with magnesium for 3 months now and my vitamin D value has doubled. Even the doctor asked me what and how much I was taking, since he rarely had patients who had such a good vitamin D level.\\nEasy to swallow because it is very small. Dosage also great, since I\\'m doing a D cure. Haven\\'t had any negative experiences so far. Top! And a thousand times tastier than drops\\nWas fast delivery and product looked nice. Just got it so don\\'t feel any difference yet. The only thing is that u can only take it 1 every 5 days? Maybe it\\'s a strong tablet?\\nSuper small mini tablets in beautiful packaging.\\nIf you take vitamin D, you inevitably have to deal with vitamin K2. Because these two preparations work synergistically. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption from food. Vitamin K2 ensures that this calcium ends up in the bones and not in the blood vessels. You can find more information on this in the recommended book \"Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox\" by Kate Rheaume-Bleue. After I\\'ve been taking vitamin K2 in drop form for a long time and it went rancid, we\\'re going to try it in capsule form. Advantages so far: no problems Dosage (just one capsule per day), good shelf life, not a greasy drop lands on the t-shirt. Problem with all supplements that are taken for general health care: the effectiveness is difficult to assess. Especially if there are no concrete problems,\\nShould support the immune system in the dark season. Due to short use, no statement can be made about the effectiveness. Tablets dissolve quickly in the mouth, so swallowing must be done quickly. For me it is important that the vitamins come from German production\\nI am very pleased. After regularly taking high doses, I am no longer deficient in vitamin D. I did a blood test before and after taking it and am therefore convinced of the effect. I wasn\\'t sure at first because I didn\\'t know the brand yet, but now I would recommend the product to anyone.\\nI\\'ve been taking D3 tablets for a number of years and recently switched to these. These are depot tablets, ie you do not have to take one tablet every day, just every five days. So far I\\'m very happy with it and can recommend it with a clear conscience.\\nI am very satisfied, the delivery was quick and uncomplicated and I tolerate the tablets well. I take K2 in conjunction with D3 and it was important to me that I was buying a product that was made in Germany. Natural Elements sells proven quality and has the highest all-trans content of any vitamin K2 product on the market. According to laboratory testing, it is 100%, quite the opposite of many manufacturers who use China goods, which, according to various market studies, sometimes do not even have an All-Trans content of 25%. The price-performance ratio is good and I have therefore already recommended the product to my friends.\\njust because nobody knows what it would have been like if you hadn\\'t taken the cabs ...... and since such products certainly don\\'t have a \"light switch effect\" or turn on any noticeable turbo, you can hardly say what an alleged one is anyway Improvement, deterioration, or even the \"state of health\" or \"fitness\" remaining the same , probably does not really understand the diverse interactions or systemic connections of our organism and is therefore possibly a bit one-sided.\\nwas looking for a natural alternative to the Vit. K2 drops that we were previously taking. However, since the drops are difficult to dose, a little more came out than intended and a few remaining drops remained in the bottle at the end and had to be disposed of, I found these capsules very interesting. What I really like is that these capsules are transparent and you can see the contents very well. Our children swallow them with their vitamin D3 and have no problem with the size of the capsules. It is important for me as an osteoporosis patient and for growing children that the additional vitamin D3 and calcium from food are stored in the bones. For me, the price-performance ratio is right here and I will buy them again.\\nIf I had a D3 deficiency, these tablets made it better, which could be seen in the blood count, and I am no longer so tired. I also take the magnesium tablets from Natural and have had no more cramps after taking them for 1-2 weeks\\nI\\'ve been taking D3K2 for years, it makes me feel really good, I take the pills even in summer, the sun isn\\'t strong enough in Germany. I have more NE from the company. I order again and again and am very satisfied.\\ndescription good is used to compensate for existing defects\\nI\\'ve been taking this supplement regularly for 6 weeks now. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to notice any change (improvement or deterioration) in my state of mind or my body feeling. Since the intake is prescribed every 5 days, I have to set a reminder alarm so that I don\\'t get confused. A different intake rhythm would definitely be easier (e.g. daily or weekly). I like the packaging (dark brown jar with a screw cap) very much, simple, attractive, pleasant size - all the tablets fit in, there is enough air at the top and the packaging is (when not in use is!) sealed with a plastic overwrap. The compressed tablets are small, tasteless and easy to swallow. Personally, I prefer capsules or these \"oil\" pellets,\\nI was looking for a K2 - MK7 made from natto by fermentation. It is very important to me that it does not contain any magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, microcellular cellulose or similar undesirables. I only found one in powder form that I have taken so far, but I fear that the vitamin will suffer from oxygen during consumption and this one from Nurela. All inquiries to the provider were answered quickly and comprehensively. And now I\\'m just hoping for the effect - I can\\'t see into myself. It will only be seen in the very long term whether I can avoid hardening of the arteries and osteoporosis. The product is surprisingly cheap, which irritated me at first, but based on the information I am assuming that it contains the same active ingredient as the much more expensive ones.\\nEasy to swallow neutral taste am very satisfied have ordered it for the second time since then no flu was otherwise very susceptible will order again and again the price is great thank you very much\\nI\\'ve bought a few vitamins from the company and I\\'m always satisfied. Can you recommend.\\nEverything OK !!\\nRecommended especially in winter. About the recommended dosage, it is of course debatable whether it is sufficient as stated there. However, everyone should do some research on the Internet before buying and taking such dietary supplements.\\nOK\\nHave been taking these capsules for over 6 months now. Vitamin level in the last examination really good.. So continue with that.\\nTo ensure better absorption and bioavailability of D3, I decided to order this K2 MK7. This package size is ideal so that you don\\'t have to keep reordering. After a short time I can\\'t say anything about the effectiveness. I haven\\'t felt any negative effects so far. However, the rather large capsules are easy to swallow. Put the capsule in your mouth, drink a lot of water (just put it in your mouth), head forward, the capsule floats to the top, then swallow it and it\\'s gone ;-). The laboratory test report I requested was sent to me immediately. It was created by LUFA-ITL GmbH in Kiel and is dated January 8th, 2018. I can only recommend the product to anyone who thinks D3 alone helps to compensate for the D3 deficiency.\\nI ordered this remedy for my wife because I think the combination of D3 + K2 makes sense. No statement can be made about the effect at the moment. The tablets are quite small, which makes them easy to take. On the other hand, one wonders whether this size actually contains the specified 5000 iE D3 and 200 ug K2. If so, all the better. Price-performance is also unbeatably good.\\ngreat\\nThe tablets are not really small but easy to swallow and tasteless in my opinion. This makes \"artificial sunbathing\" even more pleasant. The packaging is also chic and provides all the important information for the consumer.\\ngreat\\nI cannot speak of any specific independent effect of these capsules, as I take them as a supplement to vitamin D3. However, the quality is very good. The capsules are vegan and do not contain any artificial additives. This is a big plus and unbeatable in terms of value for money. They also contain flaxseed flour and are therefore a good supplier of omega 3 fatty acids. I also find the production in Germany very commendable. The only drawback for some people could be the capsule size. They are relatively large, but not a problem for me. + fast shipping + high-quality product + great value for money + German production - capsules are relatively large - plastic containers Definitely Case a clear buy recommendation!\\nI have been using vitamin K2, specifically MK7, for my vitamin D3 therapy for the past year. It ensures that vitamin D, in conjunction with calcium from food, is incorporated more effectively into the bone substance and prevents calcium from just floating around in the blood and even being able to accumulate there. I have now bought the Nurela product because I like that it contains as few additives as possible. Linseed flour as a carrier is ingenious, as it is natural and healthy at the same time (Omega3/6 fatty acids + fiber), cellulose as a vegan capsule and the Vit.K2 itself. It doesn\\'t need more! The communication with the shop owner is great! Robin, what other products do you offer? I\\'m looking forward to more! Sincerely, Patricianne\\nNot a gram less\\nI almost buy all vitamins I need from natural elements, I also recommend it to family and friends. 👏 Easy to swallow, no bad flavor. Its really so good.\\nNo problems swallowing, tasteless, and good packaging\\nI\\'ve been taking D3+K2 and omega3 and OPC for about half a year now and I don\\'t notice any physical difference. The only thing I can say is that I was never ill during this time. I\\'ll take the rest and then continue without the whole thing.\\nPleasant size, great design. Tastes like nothing. But that\\'s better than any artificially created taste. You tend to feel better, but unfortunately I haven\\'t proven the effect yet.\\nAfter a long, dreary winter, this vitamin D supplement is ideal to lighten the mood a little. The tablets are easy to swallow and have a neutral taste.\\nShould stabilize the immune system. I hope yes.\\nFast delivery, flawless and in my opinion good products from Natural Elements. Take it together with vitamin K3 5000i.E. + K2 MK7 200µg as an additional supplement to the intake of calcium and magnesium. Have had an autoimmune disease (antisynthetase syndrome with lung involvement) and I try to adjust the balance in the body to a high level in order to achieve positive effects. Of course, high dosages do not have to be right for everyone. I\\'ve been trying this for almost a year and so far there have been no negative signs or side effects - even compared to conventional medicine whose package inserts you prefer not to read. I can only recommend the product.\\nThey are easy to swallow and have no weird taste. The packaging is quite small as it only comes in a tin\\nTablets are a bit big or thick but with water it works quite well! They have no taste and the packaging is functional and pretty to look at too!\\nIts very good for health\\nWell tolerated. I can\\'t say anything about the effectiveness at this point in time.\\nI am basically very satisfied with the product (have been taking it for 1 year); What bothers me though: after a year you get a product with the same or more expensive price, but not with the ingredients = vitamin K2 has remained the same in terms of quantity, but not flaxseed flour (from 500 mg to 200 mg now) and hence the omega 3 fatty acids.. ..If you don\\'t like this, you should read this carefully!\\nI am very satisfied, the order arrived earlier. The tables are easy to swallow.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\\nNo effect! After more than 3 months of taking 10,000 IU per day, no change in vitamin D levels. Uncomfortable to swallow due to the rough surface. No purchase recommendation!\\nDelivery within 2 days. Packaging as usual attractive. Everything OK. I can\\'t judge the effect yet, because my D-value is very low at only 10 and the control is still pending\\nNice can, easy to swallow, I can\\'t say whether this supplement has an effect. I\\'m not sure about the dosage. IT IS ON THE CAN: EVERY 5 DAYS only 1 tablet. 🤔DON\\'T GET CLEVER IF THAT\\'S NOT TOO LITTLE.Only you shouldn\\'t take more, according to the manufacturer.Sometimes I forget to take it, I always have to write it down when I took the last one. I don\\'t know if it\\'s too little, because I often read elsewhere how often and how much others take. Can someone enlighten me? Thanks in advance.\\nCombination of the two vitamins together is very good.\\nI\\'m very satisfied.\\nProduct is ok, the packaging could be real glass.\\nThe tablets are small and tasteless which is very good\\nThe capsules are easy to swallow and tasteless. Value for money is okay\\nWhat more should I write about it...test verdict.... Very good\\nFast delivery I have known the product for several years and am very satisfied with it, I order it again and again\\nThe tablet is small, easy to swallow.The package lasts for a long time. Good value for money.\\nEven in the summer months, the body isn\\'t getting anywhere near the optimal amount of vitamin D, so it\\'s important to supplement.\\nI recommended this product to a friend and bought it for him too. He told me that he had problems with his knee joint. Since he supplemented vitamin D3 in combination with vitamin K2, the problem with his knee got better and he could \"run\" again, which he couldn\\'t do before taking it. I think this product is great, especially for the people who hardly got any sun and therefore start a vitamin D3 cure, supplemented of course with vitamin K2.\\nThe first ones I had were easier to take. These soften very quickly in the mouth. Otherwise I find them perfectly fine.\\nBefore I bought it, I did a little research online about what to look out for when buying vitamin K2 and this product meets all the criteria and is also affordable for pretty much every budget. I can’t (yet) say much about the effect , I\\'ve only been taking it for 2 weeks and I don\\'t even know if you really feel it. In the meantime, however, I have been repeatedly pointed out the importance of taking vitamin K2 with vitamin D. I do not find the capsules too big and they are easy to swallow for me.\\nfast and good\\nVery good! Mood is brighter and I haven\\'t even been sick all year! I will buy again!\\nAm thrilled! Since I\\'ve been taking the pills, I\\'ve definitely felt more awake than before. No more naps, no slump after a long day at work, highly recommended\\nIt\\'s just great.\\nJust take the tablets with water. The taste is neutral and the price is ok.\\nI bought this one because it has K2. Also it is really convenient to take it every 5 days.\\nGood idea to combine K2 with vitamin D. So I don\\'t have to buy K2 extra.\\nIt\\'s good\\n1 tablet every 5 days, ie taking 2.46 years, have now bought it and should I take it until February 2023, BUT BUT IS ONLY UNTIL MARCH 2021? Ok when several people swallow from the can, but I don\\'t understand it that way. Apparently the product isn\\'t so valuable that it\\'s packaged in such a way that it can\\'t be ingested?! Otherwise I only took 2, I think it\\'s a fake 5 Days 1 tablet, my father takes 20,000 ie per day (Parkinson\\'s)\\nThe shipping was super fast and the packaging is very nice. The tablets are easy to swallow, so I can\\'t comment on the taste.\\nThe product is good and I have already ordered other products from this company (iron, selenium). All the supplements I took were well tolerated. However, you have to be careful with the reviews here, because there is talk of daily intake, but this product with the description \"Depot\" should only be taken every 5 days.\\nQuestion superfluous!\\nIt\\'s all ok. taste ok\\nThe article was great and helped a lot\\nTook one pill a day at 72kg body weight and came out at 90ng/ml. I now take 6 a week. The dosage is easier than with the drops.\\nDelivery is prompt. Tablets are easy to swallow. Taste neutral. I can\\'t say anything about their (positive) effect after about 1 week. But I don\\'t feel any negative effects. I think it\\'s positive that the seller has contacted me by email and asked if I\\'m satisfied with the product. That\\'s me until now :-) . I was also happy about the 10% voucher for the next order.\\nI\\'m sorry I won\\'t send a photo, taste works, packaging is very good, everything is fine 👍👍\\nThe tablets are small and absolutely tasteless.\\nSince I\\'m not a chemist I can\\'t say anything about the ingredients...what I can say is this: subjectively I feel better physically, which is also good for me...I would take it again and again together with D3 better than Xarelto and Ramipril because of many side effects...everyone should and should decide for themselves!You can\\'t ask a doctor...he\\'s cemented on the expensive products, they don\\'t make any exceptions, but with atrial fibrillation, of course, Xarelto 20mg the pack for 300.-€Can be that it is appropriate for 70 year old and calcified arteries .. everyone has to decide for themselves.\\nno comments\\nPrice-performance ok. Fast delivery\\nTop\\nBy taking the product I was hoping for an improvement in my vitamin D levels. Instead, panic attacks, changed thought patterns, increased heartbeat, shortness of breath and other symptoms followed. I thought I was going insane until I realized it was the vitamin D supplement. After stopping it, it took a few days for me to feel better again. Since then I have never had these problems again. The product is absolutely hazardous to health! It is better to use preparations from the pharmacy, here I had none of these problems with the same dosage.\\nI can\\'t give an opinion on the taste because I \"swallow it right away\" 🙄.... take it daily because I\\'m informed that today\\'s information about requirements is not really correct and therefore I take a daily dose....\\nI\\'ve now ordered for the second time after I\\'ve used up the first can. I take the K2 capsules in addition to Vit D3 and magnesium and have successfully filled up with them. It\\'s just a shame that the price has skyrocketed. The first time the can was about 10€ cheaper. That\\'s why I\\'m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5.\\nIt\\'s just amazing how quickly that helped me, swallowed 2 tablets within 2 days (please only do this with sufficient magnesium intake). I am delighted, it is an absolutely pure product and I will buy it again !!!!\\nIndispensable vitamins and not only in the winter months. I take it because I have rheumatism. Unthinkable without it.\\nGood product as far as I have read in other sources. Just trying it for 2 weeks and yes I\\'m fine. I\\'m still fit and have no side effects.\\nUnfortunately, I can\\'t say much about this article yet, but I have a very good impression.\\nI\\'m very satisfied as I saved a lot of money with this urchase as compared with similar items from other brands.\\nGreen tea is particularly healthy in capsule or pill format and this product is great\\nOn occasion again!\\nI have been taking a vitamin combination for several months, which also includes vitamin D3. If you read up on the subject, you will learn that you should not take it without vitamin K2. So, after some research, I came across nurela’s K2 vitamin. I\\'ve only been taking this for 3-4 days now. The quality is good in my opinion (as far as I can judge as a non-chemist), the price is very cheap.What is positive to emphasize: The manufacturer does not add magnesium stearate, which is considered to be a health risk.I will in the future will definitely use this manufacturer again.\\nA capsule every 5 days because you probably know that I can\\'t say much about that yet! Maybe I\\'ll post a review later!\\nEverything OK.\\nTop product at a top price. It was also important to me that everything is organic.\\nI found this product looking for good quality at a fair price. If you consider that this is a complex manufacturing process and there are no artificial additives, it is a good offer. I tolerated the capsules well and experienced a rapid improvement. I can recommend the purchase to anyone who is familiar with the indication and the effect. Everyone else should first seek advice from experts, as is always the case with such products.\\nDelivery without problems, information on Amazon match the information on the bottle. If you want to substitute K2, you are well advised to use K2 MK7-365 capsules of 200 µg - 99.7+% All-Trans, because only this K2 MK7 All-Trans is effective, so it should contain as much All-Trans as possible. I take it together with vitamin D3, since K2 is a necessary cofactor for D3, I take a 200 µg K2 capsule for 10,000 IU of vitamin D3.\\nWell tolerated. But unfortunately I can\\'t understand whether they keep their promise. Son a good product\\nSo at the moment I\\'m giving it four stars, my body is very sensitive when I take vitamins and there\\'s an additive that\\'s sintetic, I feel bad right away and I don\\'t immediately get any unpleasant symptoms with this preparation, so I will buy again\\nI can\\'t judge the effect after a week of taking it, packaging design and price are ok so far\\nI came across the product while looking for an alternative to Japanese \"natto\" (fermented soybeans, I think they taste awful but contain vitamin K2 which is very healthy). Something else had to be found - and I found these capsules. Take it for strong bones and the vitamin is also said to be good for wrinkles ;-))). One capsule every day - and everything paletti. You get something from it for a year. I am totally satisfied and can recommend it!\\nThey are nice and small and tasteless. Everything great. The plastic packaging is therefore not quite optimal.\\nSo far we have used K2 from another manufacturer. But this had dubious additives. When I was looking for a K2 product without these dubious additives, I came across Nurela K2. The ingredients convinced me and I bought it. I think the capsules are easy to swallow. The ingredients convinced me. The K2 is made from natto and linseed flour is used as a filler. I think that\\'s a great combination. I will definitely buy this K2 again. But that will take a little longer with the crowd ;.)\\nThe tablets are very small and easy to swallow. In winter it is very important to increase the vitamin D level to increase the body\\'s defences.\\nSmall tablets, easy to swallow, right combo D3/K2, in dark glass, protected from light and the price is right\\nTablets are not too big and therefore easy to swallow. I\\'m already on the 2nd pack and it\\'s good over the winter. 👍🏻😃\\nHelp, but we only take it because of a vitamin D deficiency that has been proven by doctors.\\nThe intake is totally easy and uncomplicated. I take them every other day with my breakfast bread.\\nI was shocked at first because the packaging was so small. But since it turned out that the \"tablets\" are also very small, it worked again.\\n👍👍👍👍\\nThese are super vitamins, every 5 days, good value for money\\nI bought this product based on the positive reviews. What makes me happy is that the capsules are enough for 1 year. I don\\'t have to keep ordering. Accordingly, they are also durable. I have no problem swallowing the capsule, it is not overly large. According to bioresonance, I had a deficiency and I noticed an improvement after the first day. However, I also take two other dietary supplements. I am satisfied and will buy it again in a year!\\nAfter some searching on the net I came across this product. What I like as a consumer is that no unwanted additives were used in the production process, which is by no means a matter of course these days. And although this is the case, you get a year\\'s supply of this important one High dose vitamins and 99+% all-trans quality for such a great price. The delivery was quick and professional - I\\'m very satisfied! That\\'s great - I will definitely be shopping here again!\\nRecommended by the doctor. This can also save you some other medication.\\nI also showed the Vit. D to the family doctor and he is satisfied with the dosage + quality!\\nEverything is fine, the product fulfills everything I had hoped for.\\nFirst of all I didn\\'t want this product at all because I just wanted to reorder our K2 capsules and then the link from the orders led to this product, which looks very similar on the outside, but is a combination. But that was a mistake by Amazon, who linked incorrectly. About the product itself - both vitamin D3 and K2 are fat-soluble vitamins. I know most vendors pack them in powdered capsules or tablets. This is actually counterproductive. There are also suppliers on the market who offer D3 in oil capsules (oil caps). I always prefer, but I actually only wanted to order K2 from the same supplier, because I like to decide on the dosage myself and don\\'t like combination products. But the K2 capsules from this supplier have also shrunk and therefore contain less linseed oil than before. Very disappointing as I was actually satisfied.\\ntake vitamin D regularly and got through the winter without catching a cold\\nFast delivery, well packaged. Since I take high doses of vitamin d, I also need vitamin k2. Until you get through what you have to take in addition if you have a severe vitamin d deficiency. So I\\'m glad to have found these vitamin k2 capsules. They don\\'t have a weird taste, with a glass of water you can swallow the capsule well! As soon as my capsules are empty I will definitely order these again, since I have to take more than one a day it won\\'t last a year :-)\\nThe delivery went smoothly and I am very satisfied with the item.\\nAm very satisfied with the product\\nK2 made from MK7 was important to me. I also found it to be very good value for money. Without this Vit. K2 I wouldn\\'t be able to use the high doses of D3 that I take. It is a prerequisite for the realization of what D3 brings us. A prerequisite is also to have trust in a company that offers dietary supplements. I read a lot of good reviews and decided to order from here as well. Prompt delivery is also important. May it continue like this...Monika, 75 years old.\\nNot for the first time ordered and certainly not for the last time! Great product, well dosed!\\nAccording to a blood test, Vit. D is available in more than sufficient amounts, and that in winter.\\nA current blood analysis on me revealed a very clear undersupply of vitamin D. The regular intake of the preparation over many months has at least not shown any effect on me. The potassium value is in the normal range. I cannot rule out whether the food is not compatible with my other medication. Another purchase is out of the question for me. Therefore: please clarify in advance with trustworthy doctors.\\nSince the large pack lasts for a whole year, the price for a high-quality product is quite cheap. In connection with taking D3, nails and teeth (or jaws) have become stronger, blood clotting and healing of small wounds is also significantly improved. With a lot of luck, K2 even helps against kidney stones: I had the corresponding symptoms, which have subsided significantly! This is of course only subjective and accompanied by much hope, since K2 breaks down calcium in places in the body that are not intended, and this cannot be ruled out from a medical point of view either (cf. videos by Dr Bracht).\\nEasy to swallow, tastes ok. Good pack size. Price also fits. I won\\'t write anything about the effect here, everyone has to find out for themselves and evaluate the pros and cons or the benefits themselves. Unfortunately, that is a knockout criterion for me. I didn\\'t have anything similar with comparable drops.\\nI decided to test this product as I have a proven vitamin D3 deficiency and was looking for a supplement of this type. I felt much better after taking the pills but the price is a bit expensive\\nGood dark tablet glass (very lightproof) easy to swallow. Impressive effect. I\\'m very satisfied.\\nI am satisfied with the vitamin K2 capsules and trust that everything is in the alltrans form. If one can have vitamin K2 determined in the blood at all, it is certainly very unusual and, as always, according to doctors, there is no reason that any exotic blood value should be determined. In short, I hope that vitamin K2, together with vitamin D, will not fail to do its job.\\nIt was important to me to be certain that the product I was buying actually contained the specified amount of vitamin K2 mk7. The box in which the capsules are located is really opaque, as Vit.K is very sensitive to light. What was new for me personally is the use of flaxseed flour (Vit. K is fat-soluble) instead of oil (as is usual with other manufacturers). It probably protects the vitamin K2 from breaking down faster. The capsules, although they are about 2 cm long, are easy to swallow, which was also important for me. I am very happy to have found the product and would definitely recommend it to others. The packaging and shipping were also great .\\nProducts in glass bottles seem to me to be of higher quality than in plastic containers. So this played a part in my purchase decision. Unfortunately, the same plastic container was delivered as with many other suppliers with a completely different label. Too bad, I thought. However, due to the low price, it is acceptable to me. However, I prefer honest product images that do not mislead.\\nI think it\\'s really good and I\\'m satisfied with it\\nShipping was quick, it was well packaged. I\\'m also satisfied with the effect, especially if you don\\'t get enough sunlight, it\\'s a good balance\\nOne tablet every 5 days is easy to handle. Beautifully small and tasteless.\\nOrdered for my grandma for the second time! She is totally satisfied with this product. Price performance - great!\\nIt was perfect\\nI take these capsules more or less regularly and I think they do me good. I don\\'t notice a direct effect, but I know from experience that D3 is good for me.\\nServe your purpose, easy to use. Before use, please read the packaging regarding the intake.\\nThe product is well dosed and easy to swallow. The price is unbeatable for the quantity! I like to shop more often at Natural Elements :)\\nI can recommend.\\nThis is very important to me\\nI take the tablets because I need vitamin d3. I hope it helps.\\nSuper helpful and take two pills every day\\nIn terms of quality, I didn\\'t find any defects and the combination with vitamin K2 should complement each other well.\\nI have been taking the vitamin K2 capsules for over a year, have tolerated them well and am also satisfied with their effect in combination with a vitamin D preparation. A can with 365 capsules per corresponds to a year\\'s supply. However, when I reordered, I noticed some changes: old: new:Vitamin K2 Mk7 200 µg 200 mcgOrganic flaxseed flour 500 mg 300 mgof which omega3 fatty acids 33 mg 20 mgThe vitamin K2 content has remained the same, the proportion of flaxseed flour and thus the proportion of Omega3 -fatty acids decreased. Above all, the price for a year\\'s supply has risen from EUR 21.90 to EUR 34.99. Meanwhile (September 5th) it is 39.99. This corresponds to an increase of almost 60 or even more than 82 percent. This is extremely annoying!\\nWe take them daily and have no problems with them..everything is wonderful\\nused for bone pain\\nAs described, I am very satisfied\\nThe delivery was very fast as always, thanks for that. I\\'ve been taking vitamin D with vitamin K2 for a long time. This vitamin K2 from nurela contains flaxseed flour as a filler. This sounds good and I think that natural ingredients are definitely better. In addition, the price for this large quantity (365 capsules) is very cheap. I will definitely order these capsules again and also recommend them. I can\\'t write anything about the effect of the capsules yet because I haven\\'t been taking them for long.\\nGreat product, gladly again.\\nEasy to swallowFor food or dietary supplement\\nWas recommended to me and since it was an offer I bought it. So I can\\'t really say anything\\nhave faith ! only from the f-ma!\\nI can\\'t say how they work yet because I just bought them.\\nI chose this product because it\\'s made naturally. Something like that is very important to me. I\\'m also very careful about what I eat and how I live. Keep it up! I am happy to have found you!\\nI\\'ve been taking these capsules for a few weeks because the composition convinced me, especially the absence of dubious additives. However, I can\\'t say anything about the effect, as it should hardly be physically noticeable. What remains incomprehensible, however, is the sense and benefit of such a large pack, without there being a (smaller) alternative: now I have a very large (and relatively expensive) can standing around for a year, which is annoying, especially when it is slowly empty. It should be the same for most households. A small box with capsules for 3-4 months would make much more sense here. Addendum from 10/12/18: I\\'m now wondering whether the flaxseed flour containing omega 3 fatty acids won\\'t inevitably go rancid over the course of the 12 months of use....that would be really bad though.\\nSimply healthy and keeps the immune system high!\\nOrdered for the in-laws to take care of the body\\nit\\'s all ok\\nVery impressive and I am very happy with it\\nThe product is easy to swallow and you only need to take one capsule every 5 days\\nSuper fast, everything OK!\\nFast delivery in original packaging. My doctor thinks the product is harmless, even recommendable in combination with D3 and magnesium. I have only just started taking it and am hoping for positive results in the treatment of my serious osteoporosis. I will be happy to report on the further progress at a later date.\\nTaste neutral, size of the tablet very good also for people who have problems swallowing tablets.\\nHello, today I opened the can, as I read from the reviews, they used to be capsules, now in 2020 they are tablets or pellets, to be precise. So far so good... but unfortunately these pills are NOT coated, they are sharp and coarse. Then during swallowing, if I\\'m not quick enough, the pellet will fall apart immediately. As a customer, I am unsure from that point on. After the 3rd tablet it went down without dissolving, but it stuck in my throat, despite a lot of water afterwards. Years ago, a tablet stuck to my larynx, which led to great panic , I don\\'t want that again. With a cover, the thing would just slip under like all my other tabs. My question to the manufacturer: can I drink the pill dissolved? Well, such a customer-unfriendly swallowing object is incomprehensible. How can one think of something like that and want to offer it? Not everyone is a robust swallower, every customer is different, you have to take that into account. Normally I only rate it as pleasant, but such a panic compact just doesn\\'t work. I\\'m very sorry, but it\\'s the truth.\\nDelivery could be a little shorter\\nThe box is very small but contains many tablets. The tablets are also small and easy to swallow.\\nAs a result of the risk of the Covid-19 virus, vitamins D.\\nMiktar doğru anlaşılmıyor bir yerde 365 yazıyor baska yerde 180 şuan yine bakıyorum yıllık tablet diyor.. bu bilgilerin düzeltilmesi gerek .\\nBought several times. top quality\\nTop product. I can only recommend.\\nNice box..tablets are easy to swallow, I can only judge after some time whether the magnesium works better than my previous remedy from double bed.\\nI\\'ve been taking this product for a few days now and have the feeling that I tolerate them better than the tablets. My dog \\u200b\\u200balso gets one of these every day and tolerates them excellently. In any case, I add vitamin K2 with MK7 to my subscription order, 365 capsules would be yes an annual pack, but we are a big family. This product has convinced me and makes me feel like I can do even more for my health. Capsules are medium, so you can swallow them well.\\nI relied on the very good reviews and seller responses and ordered this product. But upon opening the package, the capsules smelled slightly fishy. So, despite the more laudable idea of \\u200b\\u200busing flaxseed meal as a carrier, the omega-3 portion of flaxseed meal has gone slightly rancid. The expiry date is absolutely ok, but it might not have been stored properly. As a 1 year supply pack it wouldn\\'t have lasted long enough so unfortunately I had to send it back. Got my money back quickly and without any problems, so I don\\'t want to judge the product too badly, something like that can happen. I also ordered magnesium from the same company and the product is impeccable. So, will definitely order the products from natural elements again,\\neverything OK\\nCool, thanks. Fast delivery, plenty of vitamin D. Great thank you 🙂\\nThe delivery was prompt and well packaged. Take one capsule every 3 + 4 weeks together with the high-dose vitamin D3. I\\'m fine with that. Definitely recommend it. I\\'m energetic and rarely in a bad mood. This food supplement definitely plays a role. Thank you for your delivery!\\nIf these were completely round, they would be easier to swallow. You can sometimes feel the edges when swallowing.\\nHere I got what I personally value very much: * the specified amount of vitamin K2 MK7 is actually included * easy-to-swallow capsules * high bioavailability Will gradually switch to natural elements for all other supplements I use! The packaging and shipping were good top & finally a clear purchase recommendation from me!\\nto make up for the lack\\nAlso know other providers. But these are also very good. I don\\'t like that the pills don\\'t have a cover (not that easy to swallow) and the jar is made of plastic. But I think it has a good effect.\\nOne tablet every 5th day is difficult to keep track of.\\nGood in itself, but since you only take it every 5 days, you get confused very quickly. Every day I find it better and also healthier for the body. The price for the quantity is of course very good.\\nThe packaging could be smaller or made of degradable material (hence a star deduction), otherwise everything is great. Nice and small, easy to swallow and dosage high.\\nSince we have been taking vitamin D in drop form for some time and the effect of vitamin D only makes sense in combination with magnesium and vitamin K2, we were looking for a vitamin K2 preparation that met the necessary criteria (vegan and not mistakenly K1 and at a reasonable price). We found this at natural elements and have been taking the preparation for almost a year now and are very satisfied.\\nPrice and performance go together very well here!\\nvery good\\nSince we unfortunately don\\'t get enough sun in Germany and Europe, especially in the cold season, bone problems are inevitable at some point. Here, taking vitamin D3 in conjunction with vitamin K2 helps to ensure that the calcium is deposited in the bones (and not in the veins!). The quality of this product is very good. We\\'ve been taking it regularly for half a year and haven\\'t had any problems. It is much cheaper here than in the pharmacy - and we trust the manufacturer.\\nI\\'ve only recently started taking these pills. They\\'re nice and small. I like them 👍\\nGood cheap value for money is good\\nEverything great.\\n👍🏻\\nOf course I can\\'t say anything about the effectiveness yet, but it\\'s great value for money.\\nGreat product!\\nEverything went super, gladly again\\nPackage arrived neatly packaged. Tablets are easy to swallow, tasteless. I would buy again and again\\nVitamin D3 + K2 depot good\\nEverything OK\\nDelivery was fine and on time. Gladly again\\nI\\'m super satisfied, shipping was fast and support was customer-friendly\\nEasy to swallow\\nI just got the can a week ago and you\\'re supposed to take a pill every five days. That\\'s why I can\\'t give a rating. (I get the request for evaluation every day!)\\nI\\'ve been wondering why I\\'ve had stomach cramps for the past few days. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t take the packaging with me on vacation due to its size. After I got home I checked whether the ampoules also contained gluten and I saw that they could contain traces of gluten and other traces such as soy and lactose. This is very bad, especially for people who have health problems. The seller\\'s first class service\\ngreat goods, again and again\\ngood product in high dosage that you can get by for longer\\nPrice / offer: Very good\\nVery good quality, good price.\\nDelivery was quick, everything was well packaged. I have been taking high-dose vitamin D3 once a week on prescription for a long time and have read that an additional intake of K2 is important. That\\'s why I ordered these capsules. I\\'ve been taking it for a few weeks now and have nothing negative to report.\\nHello I bought the product as a supplement to vitamin D. It has no aftertaste or smell of anything. It arrived safely and well packaged and much faster than expected, I\\'ll give 4 points for that. Hope that it brings the desired effect in connection with the vitamin D.

Easy to swallow and perfect as a dietary supplement, especially during the cold season.\\nTablets dissolve in powder ready in packaging the compression method doesn\\'t seem the best. In addition, the porous surface is not exactly conducive to swallowing. Too bad to order again and too good to throw away from my point of view also too low dosage swallow like 3 of them daily until they are gone. My next ones have of course been ordered elsewhere.\\nPerfect and important\\nQuality fits great\\nit was OK\\nBetter than oil for me\\nSince I only buy vitamin D3 from the shop, I think everything says it all.! Fast and reliable\\nFast and reliable... that\\'s all I can say\\nI find the tablets themselves to be tasteless and easy to swallow because they are nice and small. I\\'ve been taking 1 tablet a day for a few weeks and I haven\\'t noticed anything positive or negative.\\nThe tablets are tasteless, have rounded edges.\\nAnyone who pays attention to their health knows that this dietary supplement is a must.\\nSupplementary food of top quality\\nDark bottle is good against the light, well sealed and also has a shelf life of 2.5 years. Product consists of natural ingredients, without fillers, dyes or other harmful additives that nobody wants. I can\\'t say anything about the effect yet, I\\'ve only just started taking the product. Hope it helps against osteoporosis and arthritis. I also take vitamin D3, sango coral powder, linseed oil, omega 3 fatty acids DHA/EPA and eat a vegetarian diet from organic farming.\\nBuild a good immune system\\nHaven\\'t seen any negative or positive effects so far. Since my doctor said my potassium level was at the lowest limit, I ordered these capsules and will take them for 1 year. I\\'ll find out the result at the next blood test.\\nThe extent to which the product supports my health remains to be seen in the future. But the product arrives well packaged - I also like the dark bottle, so the capsules are not exposed to the light. The price is absolutely fair for a year\\'s supply. The rest - description and overall presentation - make a good, well thought-out and therefore trustworthy impression.\\nimportant in winter and in old age\\nThe delivery was very quick. Since this is a long-term vitamin which is responsible for calcium storage in the bones and is used to prevent and treat osteoporosis, I cannot yet provide any information about the effect as I have only been taking it for two weeks. The contents of the package last for one year and the price is absolutely fine.\\nFast delivery. Good value product.\\nI get along very well\\nExpensive but effective!\\nMedium and long-term increase in vitamin D levels!\\nThe tablets have no taste, are a little less easy to swallow and look like \"normal\" tablets. I cannot verify whether they have the prescribed amount of Vit D.\\nVery helpful for basic intestinal problems!\\nFor a long time I was looking for a high-quality vitamin K2 MK7 as a supplement to vitamin D3 supplementation, without various unnatural fillers etc. and found it here. I can\\'t say anything about the effect after a week.\\nSuper goods, fast shipping, gladly again!\\nVery fast delivery. Everything great.\\nSuper products, I am very satisfied and have recommended them a few times.\\nSince I take vitamin D3 in high doses, it is also necessary to take K2. It is also recommended to take K2 as a matter of principle, as it has positive effects on the heart and bones (clean vessels). K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin. Since there is already fat in the capsule is included, the absorption in the body is optimized.Furthermore very positive:-MK7 from natto (high bioavailability)-without artificial additivesThe introductory price is terrific.Even the later announced regular price of €39.90 for this quality is unbeatable.\\nI never rate supplemets because it affects everyone differently and you have to test it for a few weeks before you can rate it\\nHigh dose for Covid prevention and treatment\\nThe tablets are very well tolerated and easy to swallow.\\nI can only recommend the product, as I suffer from a severe vitamin D3 deficiency and am constantly tired and exhausted. Thanks to the tablets, I am fitter and full of energy again immediately after taking it for a week.\\nfelt ok\\nVitamin D deficiency\\nArticle keeps what it promises\\nHealthy and important for the metabolism of the bone and immune systems.\\nTasteless\\nI took the pills 3 times and all 3 times I got big stomach cramps the next day in the evening. I stopped taking the pill and the stomach cramps are gone. Nevertheless, I can\\'t be sure yet whether it was from the tablets, so I\\'ll try again.\\nThe product is easy to swallow\\nI\\'ve been looking for vegan and additive-free K2 tablets for a long time and finally found them. The 365 day supply pack is very good as we all (three people) take these K2 pills. I even take 2 pieces a day at the moment, because I take 20,000 iU of vitamin D3. My wife and daughter each take 8000iU which only requires one K2 tablet. I am full of confidence that I have found the right product here.\\nProduct can be taken very easily with some water. No side effects, i.e. heartburn, etc. In any case, I can see an improvement in arthritic knees. Nice that it\\'s just a capsule.\\nI can\\'t say anything about the effect yet because you just can\\'t tell after a few days of taking these capsules. That\\'s why the last star is missing. I find the 200 nanograms per capsule optimal and if it is really all trans, the purchase can only be recommended.\\nThanks\\nGood material, fast shipping, gladly again\\nFits\\nI\\'ve been taking vitamin D capsules for a long time. I ordered this because of the very good reviews. Yesterday I saw the results of my complete blood work, which listed a serious vitamin D deficiency. I take 2 tablets a day as shock therapy, i.e. 10,000 units for several months. How is it possible that there is no positive result? Unfortunately not a replacement product for me. :-(\\nGraag weer 👍\\nAll good thanks🌹🌹🌹🌹\\nEasy to swallow\\nThe product is great. After a week together with D3 and O3 I notice clearly noticeable differences in the positive. More energy, I feel better, after I dosed everything correctly, my blood pressure went down a bit. Only to recommend. What I also like is the all-trans mk7 dosage form which is the best quality and most bio available.\\nShoots well.\\nis almost delivered\\nTop product, already ordered again. There is nothing more to say about it\\npackaging very good. easy to swallow. neutral taste\\nIf you just don\\'t want to worry about whether you have enough vitamin K for your own vitamin D3 substitution in the house for a whole year, you\\'ve come to the right place. Good value for money, a producer who stands behind his product and offers to be there if you have any questions or difficulties - I like that too. The fact that the capsules are vegan is also important to me. My recommendation!\\nVery good product, especially well tolerated and the second reason why I chose it is that it does not have to be taken with fatty food because I take it in the evening and fat is less popular there. First had another product that was much more expensive, and I am therefore happy to have found this one where the price and quality are right, thank you\\nSuper product as it also includes K2\\nI have osteoporosis in the early stages. Take calcium and vitamin D. But for the calcium to be distributed well, the body still needs vitamin k2 decided on this article. Since then, the hip pain has become more bearable. It also contains a bit of omega 3.\\nGreat pills. Easy to swallow\\nI am just as satisfied with the product description, the shipping conditions and the delivery as I am with the product itself. Good product compatibility is important to me as an important supplement to taking vitamin D3 (so that it can develop its effect). The trans form of K2-MK7 and the linseed flour play an important role here. Both can be found here paired with a very good price-performance ratio (I paid EUR 23.90 for 365 capsules).\\nBe aware of the very high amount of the D3 vitamin. 5000 UI is probably too much.\\nEverything to your satisfaction\\nDissolve weirdly in the mouth... It gets very powdery so you shouldn\\'t mind.\\nI have to take vitamin D, but know that doctors recommend taking vitamin D along with K2, only then does vitamin D work as it should. After a long search I finally found the right variant: vegan, all-trans, supply for the whole year, super dosage and therefore very cheap. I can\\'t say anything specific about the effect yet. Fast delivery, nice service, well packaged. Thank you very much. Gladly again.\\nSince the regular intake of vitamin D3 has led to minor inconveniences, I have now bought this annual pack at a very good price. After 10 days of adding K2 I no longer notice any impairments and I can recommend this product at least for now. If I had noticed this company earlier, I would have gotten an annual dose of D3 cheaper here. Should this change, I will record this in an addendum.\\nExcellent! Very good!\\nGood goods, good price\\nThanks everything fine\\nI am satisfied with delivery terms and quality\\nPrice/performance ratio seems ok! H. Steinecke\\nI like this company very much, very high quality and completely ok from the price also the packaging looks totally to my liking. Very noble and reserved\\nI bought this product because I was supposed to take it with Vit. D3. Shipping and delivery hassle free. Wanted to take it in the morning because Vit. D3 is said to wake you up. But I can\\'t take it on an empty stomach (don\\'t eat breakfast) and it gives me stomach ache. Taken after a meal, I have no problems with it. Now take them in the evening with the D3 after dinner. Can still sleep easily and then have no reaction. Must try.\\nEasy to take and still a good help or support.\\nFor your information: I\\'m glad that these tablets are without oil. You don\\'t need to take D3 with fat/oil at all. That\\'s why I think the pills are great\\nIt\\'s all ok.\\ngood value!\\nGood quality. Clear purchase recommendation\\nAs always very satisfied\\nActually exactly what I\\'m looking for! Unfortunately only too little K2 (100 mcg) in relation to the amount of D3 (5,000 IU or 125 mcg). I hope that will be adjusted. With the amount of D3, 200 mcg is recommended for ingestion, so that both vitamins can work synergistically in an ideal way.\\nvery good\\nVery good 👍\\nI had good experiences with the product 2 years ago.\\nVery good..\\nlike all products from this company, simply recommended 👍🏽\\nVery well packed. The can is filled to the brim with capsules. The capsule itself is elongated. I had no problems swallowing them. You just can\\'t tell about the effect because you don\\'t notice it now. What you can say is that I didn\\'t have any side effects and they are digestible.\\nPerfect as always\\nThe tablets are easy to swallow.\\nSuper happy\\nPrice / performance is right.

Since high doses of vitamin D3 can lead to a lack of vitamin K2, we also take vitamin K2 MK7. This product provided what I wanted, natural 99+% all trans menaquinone-7 and is free of additives such as microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide. The whole family tolerates the product well. I can recommend the product.\\nI always have this product at home for all types of inflammation - and it works very well.\\nGood product\\nTip top, thank you very much.\\nI would like packaging without plastic.\\nGood product and has the perfect vitamin K2 dose. I take 1 tablet daily. Find out about vitamin D3. Good product.\\nI like taking the products from natural elements because I only have to take 1 capsule for the products, because if you take several items, such as OPC, vitamin C, D3, K2, MSM, etc., then a lot comes together when you take them , so I appreciate that these products have the required amount in one capsule.\\nFast delivery.Nice contact.And a fair price for the capsules.I can\\'t give any information about the bioavailability,but I rely on the supplier (manufacturer)Vitamin K2 is important with the same additional intake of calcium and D3.Everything should be as it is be described, I will order the capsules again. Therefore, up to here, a clear purchase recommendation.\\nit\\'s all ok\\n...is known to die last ;-) By taking vitamin K in conjunction with high-dose vitamin D and other therapies, I hope for an improvement in the diagnosed osteoporosis. Since bones are known to need more time to change, I can\\'t say much about this at the moment say product. At least it was delivered very quickly, can be taken without any problems and I can\\'t report anything negative so far.\\nIs easy to swallow am satisfied\\ngreat product\\nI\\'ve been taking vitamin K2 for a while now. So far, unfortunately, I have only found products that contain additives as fillers that I don\\'t really like. I\\'ve always wondered, \"does it have to be?\" Nurela has a simple but brilliant idea here: flaxseed flour (which also contains the fat needed to take vitamin K2), and nothing else. Just awesome! Thanks for this great idea.\\nExcellent price\\nUsing since a month can\\'t say how effective is it.\\nI take it every 2nd day because it\\'s 200ug, 100ug would be a good daily dose, so it\\'s theoretically more than a year\\'s supply, depending on how much you take it! The flaxseed/omega3 is also a nice addition that goes great with vitamin D3 intake. The pack was easy to open, looks good, the capsules are well filled, in my opinion the best K2 product.\\nI am very satisfied with the product and the timely delivery\\n.... my mom wanted to test these vitamins and was thrilled\\nBefore taking K2 in combination with D3, I had my vitamin D level measured. Of course, you can only determine after some time whether the combination leads to better bioavailability of D3 for my bones. I decided on this product because it does not contain any synthetic ingredients. The capsules are easy to swallow and have a completely neutral taste.\\nDelivery and product, everything is great...can\\'t say anything about the effect yet because I\\'ve only been taking it for a week. I\\'ll give the 5th star later when I can say something more about it.\\nI took the product as a dietary supplement.\\ngood product!\\nGood\\nSuper product, as already said in the description, without unwanted frills. What I particularly like is that the bioavailability is already guaranteed by the omega3 fatty acids it contains and I don\\'t always have to think about taking the capsule with food. Also vegan - it couldn\\'t be better! For me, in connection with vitamin D, a must in the winter time :)\\n-\\nSmall packaging with many small tablets. Good product\\nEasy to swallow .\\ngladly again and again\\nPrice - product - fast delivery\\nI would like to rate the tablets well. After taking it for a long time and as recommended, my D3 level is as low as it was in February after the winter. The naturopath now prescribed me capsules with linseed oil, since the D3 has to make it into the intestines to be absorbed there and is fat-soluble. It cannot be properly absorbed by tablets or drops with oil. I don\\'t know my K2 value, so I can\\'t rate this.\\nI am very satisfied with the purchase of the vitamin supplement. K2 is one of the fat-soluble vitamins, so it makes sense to combine it with flaxseed. Otherwise no further additions. The delivery was very prompt, the capsules are easy to swallow, the advantage is that they are entered once a day. I will buy the product again 👍👍\\nDescription good and understandable. Otherwise everything ok, what more do you want to describe or rate such a product. In short: fits.\\nGreat product, I\\'ve been taking it for a while and I feel really good.\\nI was looking for a vitamin K2 product where the capsules or tablets are not too big because I have a little trouble taking them. Delivery was quick after ordering. The capsules are not too big, so they can be swallowed with water without any problems. So far I haven\\'t noticed any side effects. I\\'ve been taking these for almost 2 weeks.\\nTop\\nWell\\nSince this vitamin is not available in a conventional pharmacy, I luckily found it here. Since I have to take K2 in conjunction with B, I was extremely satisfied with how quickly and easily I received this product. I have no side effects. My blood counts (K) are getting better and better. Many Thanks.\\nSince I have arthrosis-related pain in my joints, a therapy with K2 and D3 was suggested to me. I\\'ve been trying this for a year now and it suits me very well. Painkillers could be reduced. Even climbing the stairs has gotten better.\\nI take the capsules in combination with vitamin D3 and magnesium. It was important to me that it was pure MK7 vitamin K2 with an all-trans content. I am super satisfied with the product and tolerate it very well. I think it\\'s great value for money, I can only recommend it.\\n\"Free of magnesium stearate, release agents, flavors, colorings, stabilizers, gelatine and of course also GMO-free, lactose-free, gluten-free & without preservatives\" - an ideal condition for vitamins, conveniently in the form of a not too large capsule! I\\'ve only recently started taking this vitamin, but I have no doubts that it will be very useful to me in the long term. Nothing to complain about in terms of delivery and packaging :-)\\nI started taking this during winter because my therapist recommended it. Honestly I haven\\'t felt any difference so far (6 months later), but who knows 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️\\nwe take vitamin D3 capsules and it took us a long time to find out that without the vitamin K2 these are not properly absorbed by the body. If you imagine how bad it was for us over the winter because we bought a ! year\\'s product for just under Didn\\'t have €20. Now we\\'re all taken care of because we take K2 every day. Vegan, without chemicals and inexpensive. 1000 thanks.\\nIf the ingredients are not fudged, and I assume that is the case with a German product, then everything is ok.\\nfits\\nEasily swallowable.\\nGood\\nWell\\nWell\\nEasy to swallow\\nIt should be made clearer that you can only take 1 tablet in 5 days.\\nI take it together with vitamin d3. What I think is great is that there are so many capsules in it and even though I take it with my husband, there is still more than half in it. In terms of price, it was great, but unfortunately the price is increasing... What I\\'m wondering is: has the name of the company changed?\\nSo far all good. I bought it to supplement with calcium.\\nAs always a good product in combination with D3 and Magnesium, long lasting and good value for money. Good dosage, thanks to the pipette. I\\'ll do a D3 blood test soon, then I\\'ll see if it helped or not, and I\\'ll update my review accordingly.\\nI have not yet started taking the Vit. K2 capsules. I\\'ll be happy to leave a review once I\\'ve started. I can say in advance, very fast delivery, well packaged, everything looks very neat! I\\'ll get back to you!\\nGood alternative to the drops. They are small and easy to swallow.\\nTop\\nGladly again.\\nThey are so tiny!!\\nI also needed a K2 vitamin for my vitamin D intake. I chose this product because it has no artificial additives. The capsules also contain organic linseed oil, so that the vitamin D is better absorbed. I tolerate the product very well and can recommend it with a clear conscience. The price is also great compared to other products.\\nSimply a great product\\nFast delivery. I can\\'t say anything about the effectiveness yet. Pleasant to swallow.\\nKeeps what it promises!\\nI am very satisfied with these capsules because they meet all the important criteria for optimal effectiveness/bioavailability and are very well priced. I\\'ve researched long enough to be able to judge this.- High dose-Only 1 capsule a day-Without microcrystalline cellulose-Without magnesium stearate-K2 MK-7 all-trans form> 99%, not the ineffective cis form-Price/performance/quantity relationship great\\nI am very satisfied with this product and its value for money. I tolerate the capsules without any problems and can\\'t find any problems. Best of all: no harmful (or dubious) additives! Important information that I asked for and would like to pass on: Although they are not oil capsules, you don\\'t have to eat anything fatty with them (vitamin K2 is fat-soluble), since the flaxseed flour they contain takes over.\\nK2 MK7 is essential for heart and bone health (for me in combination with serrapeptase and niacin). The potency of 200 micrograms is great compared to 100 mcg from most other suppliers. The purity of the product is also a big plus for me. Thanks, I\\'ll be happy to shop here again! Evgeni Radev, Bulgaria\\nThe tablets are really easy to swallow and taste normal.\\nCompletely satisfied!\\nvery good\\nBecause I currently I have to take vitamin D capsules and at the same time need a K2 vitamin for optimal Ca distribution, I decided on nurela because it does not contain any unhealthy additives.\\nMust have for EVERYONE\\nIt is very good value for money, can only be recommended. I have nothing negative to say about the product, I tolerate the product well.\\ngreat product\\nI take this K2 preparation for my vitamin D supply and feel very good with it. I also really like the attitude towards nature on the part of the nature Love company. I am happy that there is a company that tries to give the best. Please keep it up!\\nSimply good.\\nI think the combination of Vit.D3 and Vit.K2 is the best solution.\\nI use them often. Only to be eaten once every 5 days.\\nIt\\'s not the only product I buy from this company, I\\'m very satisfied.\\nStrengthen immune system\\nI can really say that I get a positive effect from taking the vitamin pills! So highly recommended!\\nThe delivery came very quickly. The capsule size is ok. You can easily swallow them. Since I take high doses of Viatmin D3, I need K2 for this. When choosing the preparation, it was very important to me that K2 does not contain any additives. Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t tolerate the preparation from another supplier that I recently bought (it has microcrystalline cellulose).\\nGood price and very effective\\nI am very pleased. Ingredients declared and was well sealed when I received it. I can\\'t say anything about the effect yet - I bought it so that my vitamin D can be better utilized in the body. Blood test coming in 3 months. But I am satisfied with the delivery and the content.\\nEverything great\\nFast delivery. Well sealed. Product as described. Have been taking it for a long time. Pain in the shoulder, so-called calcified shoulder, could no longer raise my arms and neither lie on the right nor on the left to sleep, has almost completely disappeared. In my opinion, a very good product which I will continue to use will.\\nI\\'ve been using this product for a while and I\\'m very happy with it. Especially in combination with vitamin D substitution, it is important for me to take enough vitamin K2. Will continue to buy the product.\\nThe product was packaged well and delivered quickly. The vitamin K2 capsules are large but easy to swallow. I think I\\'m seeing an improvement and would therefore recommend the capsules. In general, the natural elements products are recommended.\\nis a great product, I take it because K2 MK7 is great for wrinkles & osteoporosis. The same ingredients as in Japanese \"natto\" - but with the best will in the world I couldn\\'t get this fermented soy dish down. These capsules are the much better choice and also the cheaper one :-).\\nI am happy to have found your vitamin K2, because they are without additives, but with the valuable flaxseed omega 3 fatty acids. Are digestible and easy to take. The price is also right, because these last me for a year. A real natural product and I can recommend it! I will order it again.\\nI am very pleased\\nCan\\'t say anything yet.\\nEverything was great\\nfast delivery, consistency and packaging makes a good impression. The intake time is too short to assess the possible mode of action. So far nothing speaks against a renewed order.\\nGood\\nI have already taken 365 capsules and thus improved my vitamin K 2 content. I hope that this will reduce or improve my arteriosclerosis in my legs (intermittent claudication). I believe in the leaflet and think I bought a good and inexpensive product.\\nI didn\\'t get it in the long run because I got stomach pains.\\nI need K2 for the combination with my Vit. D3 because I keep having back and joint problems. After about 2 weeks I feel a noticeable improvement in my symptoms. I am very satisfied with the quality of this product.\\nSince I have to take high-dose vitamin D, I ordered the K 2 from nurela, because vitamin D can then work better. I was convinced by the good ingredients and the great price! After taking it for 14 days, I can\\'t say whether it works, but I will report further\\nSupppppppper\\nI have always used K2 in the form of drops, but since I prefer a more solid form on vacation, I ordered this one. The capsules are easy to swallow and have no taste of their own. I am very satisfied and will order them again at any time for the vacation.\\nVery good product and with certificates. Mk7, 99.7% alltrans and microencapsulated. The most important points of the K2 that few manufacturers meet. Take the K2 with Omega3 in the triglyceride form and D3 and that\\'s where it\\'s important to have a good K2. Will buy again\\nD3 and k2 are super important for everyday life, that\\'s a good dosage\\ngreat product\\nPractically\\nDelivery was fine and quick. Had previously taken this vitamin from another supplier. Since the ratings for this product are very good, no unnecessary additives are used and it is an annual ration, I decided to use it. Take K2 to V D3. I can\\'t say anything about the effect. When I opened the can, I noticed a strong fishy smell. I don\\'t find that very pleasant. Wonder if that\\'s from the flaxseed.\\nHealth\\nThe product was delivered within two days. I bought it because the capsule contains no additives other than flaxseed flourUse because of a recommendation as part of a vitamin D3 refill - but I can\\'t say anything about the effect as it\\'s only been in use for a few daysTolerance excellent, no negative effects whatsoever\\nI use it to replenish my reserves of vitamin D after the winter\\nEverything was great every time again. A great product.\\nvery good\\ngood value for money, good design, fast delivery, nothing can be said about the effect yet, since the intake has only just started\\nMy naturopath advised me to take vitamin K. I came across the capsules from natural elements here. Value for money is great and the fact that the capsules are vegan also convinced me. The capsules arrived quickly and safely packaged.\\nGood.\\nGood\\ntop products\\nDelivery very fast. Item very good. Should increase the body\\'s defences.\\nI thought the tablet shouldn\\'t bring any side effects but unfortunately it does at the very first one. I have had a bit of fatigue, brain fog... So I guess I couldn\\'t consume the rest any more.\\nThe vitamin capsules arrived quickly and could be used immediately. I have been looking for vitamin K2 MK7 of this quality for a long time, have been taking them for several days and am very satisfied so far.\\nCan not complain. On time, neatly packed! Everything great!\\nI am trying this vitamin for the first time.\\nI ordered the capsules for my mother and me. I\\'ve been taking it for a few weeks and I think I\\'m noticing effects in terms of D3 and calcium utilization. I\\'ll keep an eye on the progress via blood control. In any case, I will continue to swallow them diligently. For vegans, the preparation is a good thing.\\nI ordered the (predecessor) product some time ago because of the specification. Since I have to take increased calcium (with D3), I take K2 to avoid calcium build-up in the arteries. My osteoporosis and deposits in the carotid did not deteriorate. Recommendation to buy!\\nI use it as a dietary supplement\\nI received a very good product at a fair price. The vegan capsules are easy to take and well tolerated.\\nREALLY perfect\\nFast delivery, good so far. It is good that only one tablet is taken every five days.\\nEverything great\\nI am really very positively surprised by this great price-performance ratio. Before I always ordered much more expensive with much less content. Everything is great here: great delivery, great packaging, great quality. When the year is over and I need more, I\\'ll be happy to order again :-).\\nThe problem is that it contains very high content of vitamin D3 and normal content of K2. So the recommended dosage is one pill per 5 days to stay safe from overdosing the D3(which can be dangerous). That means that you don\\'t have much K2 in the mean time.\\nif this product is good and I assume it is, then I am very satisfied, the quantity - for 376 days - and the content of the individual capsules are convincing. I share this product with my wife and so a new order is due in five months at the latest.\\nSuper super superI\\'ve tried quite a few dietary supplements, looking for the best one, and I absolutely stuck with this one because it exceeded my expectations. After a few days you can feel the effect. Would even give six stars because they clearly stand out from others.\\nEffect can only be assessed in a few weeks, but the product in general is highly recommended! If vitamin K2 is required (if you take vitamin D3 you should always take K2 as well, it improves the absorption of D3) this product is definitely one of the best! The fact that it is also Menaquinone MK7, which can be \"processed\" better by the body, is a plus point. One capsule per day with this can gives a year\\'s supply! - - > recommended!\\nAfter more than a week a tablet daily I have not noticed any effect. Not feeling any fitter or anything despite the dark days we\\'re already having. Let\\'s see how long you have to take that or if you even notice anything. I\\'ll keep taking it but I\\'m a little disappointed...\\nEasy to take. Positive effects cannot be stated yet, since it has not been taken for long.\\nAs a supplement to my vitamin D3 intake, I ordered vitamin K2. With 99.7+% All-Trans, the product has a very good quality at a good price. Delivery was one day after ordering.\\nFast delivery, the worst pills I\\'ve ever had Sharp edges and blunt\\n:)\\nTop\\nI decided on this product after a week of research. I\\'ve been taking it daily for a week it\\'s too early to decide on the effect, but I will always take it in the future because k2 is very important for health.\\nDelivery was on time. Unfortunately, it is not specified by which laboratory the product was tested and whether the ingredients are guaranteed to be included.\\nSuper product, vitamin K2 must definitely be supplemented with vitamin D3. I\\'m thrilled I bought the entire range of K2 and D3 plus magnesium for my family, they are thrilled.\\nJust great, always happy, I\\'m satisfied and everything super :-)\\nGood product. Helps through the flu season\\nEasy and has no side effect from this product. I\\'m very satisfied\\nMeet my expectations\\nI bought the product because, firstly, it lasts for a year and thus eliminates the need for annoying repeat orders and, secondly, it is free of artificial additives and has also been checked for typical impurities. The delivery took place within the stated period and communication with the company was very friendly.\\nThe vitamin K2 capsules from natural elements arrived on time and reliably. In addition, the price-performance ratio of products from the company \\'natural elements\\' is extremely fair. I can only recommend this company. Keep it up !\\nI take vitamin K2 in addition to the vitamin D preparation, it is important for me that the tablets do not contain any artificially produced magnesium stearates, since these are mostly produced from genetically manipulated products.\\nI am completely satisfied with this K2 and will order it again. No unnecessary additives are crucial for me, for all dietary supplements etc. Natural elements is very friendly and makes sure that the customer is satisfied. Thank you and keep it up.\\nArrived quickly, easy to swallow, results still unknown, only 2 taken\\nI chose this product because I liked the ingredients (without chemicals) and it gave me a \"more natural\" impression than other products of this type. Of course I can\\'t say anything about the effectiveness after such a short time (if a such can be assigned so clearly at all...).\\nEverything great!\\nEverything looks good. Only a blood test could tell if it works.\\nAll in all a good product, it was recommended to us by a non-medical practitioner.\\nAbsolutely satisfied !!! Super value for money, you really get the entire year\\'s supply in a large dark container. The capsules are easy to swallow, the ingredients are absolutely natural and tasteless. The capsules were shipped super fast. I will definitely buy this product again.\\nI\\'ve been taking vitamin D3 and K2 for several years and I like to try different manufacturers to find the best product for me. Although I\\'m usually very happy to buy from this manufacturer, I\\'m dissatisfied with this product. Despite adhering to the consumption recommendation, I get a very bad headache and have to stop using the product after 7 weeks. I hardly ever get a headache, which is an indication to me that my body is not happy about eating it. Too bad.\\nVery good product. The list of ingredients speaks for itself. It is important to me that there are no unnecessary additives and that the dosage of each capsule is reasonable, this is given with this vitamin K2. It is also very well tolerated. Will definitely keep ordering it.\\nIn general, I am very satisfied with all of their products. Not only because the price-performance ratio is extremely favorable, but because their products fulfill what they promise. You have convinced me!!! So not only will I recommend them, I\\'m in the process of recommending them.\\nI always get a little nauseous after taking a pill, which indicates an overdose! Supposedly you should only take one tablet with 5,000 IU every 5 days but this only makes sense with a retard function which I don\\'t think is given! Better 1,000 IU once a day than 5,000 IU once for supposedly 5 days...\\nhard to swallow\\nLeuk.\\nExcellent product, I can only recommend it, I use it in combination with vitamin D3 on the advice of my naturopath, since I\\'ve only been using it for a short time I can\\'t say much about its effect, but the \"prophesied\" side effects have not occurred so far.\\nDeutsche Premium Qualität? Die dunkle PE-Flasche ist im Verhältnis zum Inhalt deutlich zu groß, wurde ohne Umkarton im üblichen Versandpaket geliefert, enthält kein MHD. Abgesehen von glatten Schabspuren auf dem Deckel schien ansich alles merkwürdig aber wohl doch in Ordnung zu sein.Der Deckel ließ sich extrem schwer öffnen. Es gelang nur mittels einem feuchten Handtuchs und einer großemauligen Rohrzange. Bei dem Vorgehen blieben die Flasche und der sehr solide Deckel bis auf ein paar Druckspuren heil und wiederverschließbar.Nach dem Öffnen strömte mir ein unangenehmer fischartiger Geruch entgegen. Der Geruch stammt von den Kapseln und manifestiert sich beim Schlucken als Geschmack. Einen etwa aufstoßenden Nachgeschmack konnte ich nicht verzeichnen. Seitdem verströmt auch die wieder verschlossene Flasche den mir völlig unbekannten, allerdings nicht an Schädlichkeit erinnernden Geruch.Da der Fischgeruch in einer Rezension bereits bekannt gemacht wurde, sehe ich hier keinen einzelnen dumm gelaufenen Ausreißer sondern schreibe meine Rezension und versehe sie mit der notwendigen Warnung. Die Lieferung muss ich reklamieren.\\nDoes what it should\\nI use the capsules, because with the vitamin as an all trans version, vitamin D can be absorbed much better by the body. Very nice and quick delivery service - the product is exactly what it should be, everything is good!\\nWas meant to try but prefer the drops\\nDue to a blood test I had to take Vit D. For the time being I decided on the pharmacy pills (I don\\'t like to name the brand). As a result, the VitD level has improved. After I finished the pack I decided to purchase this product. About 1 week later I had the known side effects again. I then bought the pharmacy pills again and the side effects disappeared within hours. I conclude that they don\\'t work for ME and therefore only deserve one star. Other products from this manufacturer are great and I\\'m very satisfied, but this one doesn\\'t even seem to contain what it says on it. no-go!\\nPerfect\\nI deliberately chose the vitamin K product from natural elements because I can only get a monthly pack of inferior quality from other manufacturers for the same price. I have ordered other products such as D3 and OPC from natural elements.\\nvery good price-performance ratio! high-quality product because vegan! high dosage, that\\'s how it should be! i use it together with vitamin d3, highly recommended, they belong together so that calcium gets into the bones and is not deposited in the blood vessels! stefan\\nMy family and I are enthusiastic about the natural ingredients and the compatibility of this dietary supplement. One capsule is taken every day after lunch and the pack lasts for a whole year per person, super practical. We are very satisfied and I can only recommend it!!!\\n... I\\'m processing my order at natural elements. The delivery was prompt. The vegan product fully meets my idea of \\u200b\\u200ba dietary supplement and since it contains 365 capsules I have \"rest\" for a year.\\nProduct container smells like nothing, which I think is good. I tolerate intake well, so it\\'s great.\\ngreat product\\nUse these capsules to supplement vitamin D 3. Very well tolerated after more than a month of use - can\\'t find any negative side effects. In my opinion, the container is very large - could be smaller - but overall I can still give a purchase recommendation because the price-performance ratio is right.\\nI bought this product a year ago on the recommendation of a friend and absolutely love it. In combination with vitamin D, which I also buy here, a blessing.\\nGood handling, as it is only taken once a week... extremely fast shipping... perfect...\\n👍👍👍🤪😇\\nBisher keine Probleme mit etlichen Produkten von anderen Herstellern. Der Preis hier hat mich überzeugt und ebenfalls ein super Marketing!Über die Wirkung des Produkts kann ich nichts sagen, jedoch nehme ich schon lange Supplemente andere Hersteller und wollte D3/K2 und Zink mal wider aufstocken. Nach 2 Tagen täglicher Einnahme bekam ich sehr viele Pickel, trotz super gesundem Lebensstil! Nach absetzen der Pillen gingen diese wieder weg! Der Markt ist nicht reguliert und man kann alles reinhauen und muss nichts explizit drauf schreiben. Was für drin ist keine Ahnung, aber ich bezweifle dass es gesund ist!Lieber ein paar € mehr ausgeben und auf Apothekenprodukte oder Produkte die man schon kennt vertrauen.\\nReceive the goods directly within 2 days! Product received in great condition. The product is very inexpensive considering that it can be consumed for a year.\\nI think it\\'s good that Nurela doesn\\'t synthesize the vitamin K2 chemically, but instead sells it obtained from natural natto. Since vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, it is also wise to embed the vitamin in a fatty flaxseed flour so that it can be easily absorbed by the body.\\nI found this product looking for good quality at a fair price. If you consider that this is a complex manufacturing process and there are no artificial additives, it is a good offer. I tolerated the capsules well and experienced a rapid improvement. I can recommend the purchase to anyone who is familiar with the indication and the effect. Everyone else should first seek advice from experts, as is always the case with such products.\\nlasts 5 days, so lasts a long time....I would buy again.....\\nWould prefer not to give a star at all, got palpitations and a panic attack, and felt unwell for several hours! They are really super high doses, in pharmacies or drugstores in Germany you don\\'t get vitamin D in such high doses! Can\\'t believe this is sold on Amazon and has so many good reviews. Still feeling weird a day after taking it, my doctor said I couldn\\'t tolerate one of the ingredients as my reaction to the amount was not normal. Can only advise against buying.\\nThe price\\nIn itself one can only say good things. The only thing that surprises me a little is why there is flaxseed flour in it. If that would change the price, you should consider removing it.\\nThe delivery was quick. I take this product in combination with high-dose vitamin D3. . This product is additionally combined with linseed flour and thus improves the absorption of vitamins in the body. I tolerate these capsules very well and have no side effects.\\nFeedback on the capsulesVery fast delivery Well packaged, no chemical smell or taste on the capsules shouldn\\'t be advertised with Vegan Nems (actually!) Now vitamin D3 is refilled again over the winter or maintenance dose because the vitamin K2 MK7 is also very important the all-trans is natto and not CIS! therefore high bioavailability, without artificial additives, price-performance fits, therefore full points will also test the Camu Camu!\\nThe pills were there immediately.\\nDelivery and packaging very good, at the announced time. After the delivery I received a 10% discount code on my next order, which is not a matter of course. I am convinced of both the service and the preparation, not least because the price_performance ratio is very good\\nBefore ordering, my questions were answered quickly and very nicely. The capsules were delivered very quickly and were in perfect condition. You can\\'t judge the effect directly, but they suit me very well, I have no problems with them. The price-performance ratio is right.\\nUse this product in conjunction with vitamin D and magnesium citrate. Can\\'t report anything negative, except that the tablet might be a tick smaller. Otherwise, I find it very good value for money. Will buy again.\\nThere\\'s not much more for me to say - vitamin D3 doesn\\'t work without K2 - the two simply belong together. Great quality and dosage - I\\'ve already become a fan of Natural Elements anyway!\\nVery fast shipping, I think flaxseed flour is excellent as a filler for a fat-soluble vitamin, I take it as a supplement to my vitamin D oil, in my opinion a trustworthy supplier on the NEM market\\nReceived this product quickly and well packaged. I combine this product with vitamin D3. It may well be that it is a coincidence, but since taking it for over a week my whistling noise in my ear has almost gone. So it can go on like this.\\nWhen taking high-dose vitamin D, K2 MK7 is necessary. This product meets all the requirements I have set: no chemical ingredients, no magnesium stearate, including fat from organic linseed flour for better utilization, no oversized capsules. The price for a year\\'s supply is absolutely OK.\\nAm very satisfied with the service. Price performance is also right. I am taking these K2 capsules for the first time, so it is not possible to say anything about the effect, although this is difficult to assess with K2 anyway. At least without additives, that\\'s why my first choice.\\nI am super satisfied with this product. Very fast delivery. The price is ok for me too. I also like that the product is manufactured here in Germany under constant quality checks. Thanks very much!\\nGood nutritional supplement for the extra portion of vitamins\\nSuch pure and high-dose K2 is not easy to find! My husband gets it for his high blood pressure together with OPC and it works better than any pill!!! So he got everything under control! Thanks for that !!\\nIt\\'s a little hard to rate a dietary supplement after only a week or two, but I\\'ll do it anyway. It looks serious and I think I\\'m seeing an improvement! I\\'ll definitely be trying more products! Plus, it\\'s among all the K2 vitamins one of the few \\'all trans\\' products! Folks no \\'all trans\\' no effect just profit for the production company!\\nexactly what i wanted\\nDelivered super fast - 1 day. thanks again\\nsuperfood\\nI bought the product because of the composition. The organic flaxseed meal is not only a filler, but also provides omega 3 at the same time. All the best\\nAfter two weeks I can\\'t say much yet\\nI ordered the capsules because I take them with vitamin D. I liked the composition of the preparation. I tolerate the capsules well. Thanks for the fast delivery\\nI am very dissatisfied with the product. Will order again!\\nAlways looking for the best for my body. I need a good K2 for my D3. without a lot of fillers and additives. This is given here. thank you and gladly again at any time. Packaging was great, delivery time was great\\nWhen taking vitamin D3, it is well known that vitamin K2 should also be taken. The dosage of 1 capsule daily seems reasonable and there are no questionable fillers. Overall a \"very good\".\\nGreat products, already bought MSM, K2, D3, Camu camu and Hyaluron. Everything natural does not contain any waste like the products from the drugstore. I\\'m glad I came across Natural Elements. I would buy again and again\\nEasy to swallow and with K2\\nFast delivery, product as described and securely packaged\\nSo far I haven\\'t noticed any change. Have been taking these for a few days.\\nCapsules arrived safely. I can\\'t say much about the effect. With D3 and K2 in combination I have always been able to avoid all diseases quite well. So I\\'m just assuming a positive effect.\\nI was looking for a product that was free of chemical additives such as magnesium stearate. I\\'ve obviously found the right one for me. The capsule size is ok. The price-performance ratio is ok for me. Recommendation!\\nPurchase perfect all around - very nice and good service, fast delivery and the goods are perfect. I was particularly impressed by the high dosage and production in Germany. The absence of animal ingredients was also important for my purchase decision.\\nK.A\\nFast reliable delivery all the best I would recommend\\nsmall white tablets without a capsule (vegan-important for me) nice dark box and very easy to dose. I\\'ve only had it for a few days so I can\\'t say more about it yet.\\nHad been looking for a good and healthy K2 for a long time. The crowd matters! An absolute must for me who wants to consume vitamin D3 with it ;) Price: great! Size of the capsules: just right! Neither too big nor too smallQuantity: annual ration!\\nOrdered late Friday afternoon, Monday morning at the packing station, that\\'s great. Give five stars for now, adjust the review again if necessary if I can say more about the product itself. In any case, on paper it fulfills all the essential requirements for an effective K2 preparation. (Which one should actually only use if a deficiency has actually been proven and not prophylactically. Getting it through nutrition is always the better way.) Value for money is also a plus.\\nJust like it should be\\nThe delivery was quick, the goods were well packaged. I combine this product with vitamin D to prevent osteoporosis and will order again.\\nYes what can I say, good price for a large stock. And, at least according to the manufacturer, the product is all-trans too. You can confidently throw any K2 product without an \"all-trans\" or \"cis\" label in the bin.

Otherwise the product is OK.\\nGreat as always...\\nVery pleased\\nHigh quality\\ngreat\\nEverything top ftom A to Z\\nThe pills are good...and easy to swallow.\\nGreat everything fine\\nI love these products\\nPrice is unbeatable. Reputable (certificate from a real existing laboratory). No abnormalities such as a bad or acrid smell or similar. No side effects observed. Good preparation all in all.\\nAs expected.\\nA year pack of K2 at this price. Perfect. You can already see from the capsules their high quality and that it is a real natural product. I won\\'t buy my supplements anywhere else. Will try the whole range\\nWhat I particularly like about the product is that it does not contain any additives such as magnesium stearate, release agents, coloring agents, etc. Furthermore, it is a product \"made in Germany\". So thumbs up from me and next time again!\\nUnfortunately, this product gave me restlessness and heart problems. However, since I react to countless medications and dietary supplements with side effects, this will not affect the majority of customers. What is outstanding, however, is the very friendly customer service, which immediately answered my inquiry about the satisfaction guarantee and arranged for the price to be refunded. Top!\\nOrdered on Saturday, received on Monday. Everything perfect. We recommend. I have already bought 4 products from Nature Love and have always been very satisfied. Both with the service and with the products.\\nyes\\nI was looking for a good vit k 2 preparation because of my high-dose Vit D intake. Because I pay attention to being vegan and without chemicals, I found these capsules appealing to me. The capsules are easy to swallow. Thanks, I will order again\\nDue to allergies, I decided on this product (combination of vitamin D3, K2 and magnesium) and so far I can only report positive things. The delivery also came very quickly, so that I could start the vitamin \"therapy\" immediately\\nA good product at a good price 😊\\nSeems to do the job.\\nThe purchased products arrived very quickly, the goods were well packaged. All in all, a very solid business transaction. The capsules themselves are slightly larger than other brands, which can sometimes be annoying depending on the individual. Personally, it doesn\\'t cause any problems for me.\\nDelivery and packaging are perfect. I can\\'t say anything negative about the quality of the capsules. At least the product description sounds promising, especially since Omega 3 is also included. I am very pleased\\nThis product doesn\\'t describe if its vitamin D comes from natural sources.Actually it doesn\\'t say its source at all.\\nEverything makes a very high-quality impression. The capsules are easy to swallow. The quantity and size are ideal. The capsules can also be easily opened if you want a different dosage. The capsules have a shelf life of 2 years. Everything is great, will buy these capsules again.\\nFrom the delivery to the packaging to the product itself - I am very happy with this product. Highly recommended\\n\"My doctor recommended vitamin K2 MK7 capsules in addition to the vitamin D3 drops. This should improve absorption. I am very satisfied with the product, it was delivered quickly.\"\\nWe have been taking the capsule in conjunction with cod liver oil for over 6 months and are very satisfied. Joint and back problems have decreased significantly and our general well-being has also improved.\\nGood goods at a good price.\\nWe have been buying this preparation for over two years, are extremely satisfied with it and will continue to order it in the future.\\nThank you ! all ok\\nMany Thanks. The delivery was quick and very well packaged. I can\\'t give an opinion on the effectiveness after the short time, but the dosage and package size is efficient and easy to handle for me.\\nAs always, I was very satisfied with the fast and uncomplicated delivery. Thank you for this great and pure product. It helps me (together with vitamin D) excellently against my calcified shoulder and against my tingling feet. Clear purchase recommendation\\nFast delivery, I am satisfied with the product. The price-performance ratio is right and the capsules are of plant origin. As a layperson, it is difficult to judge the effectiveness, since the effect (promotion of calcium incorporation into the bones with the help of vitamin D, protection of the arteries from calcification) cannot be felt. This would require special medical laboratory tests (e.g. before the start of intake and 6 months afterwards).\\nI have a few products from this manufacturer but I cannot recommend these D3/K2 tablets at all. The tablets are difficult to swallow. They are too big and blunt that even a lot of water can hardly get them down the esophagus. Such an uncomfortable feeling can make you panic. If I hadn\\'t opened the packaging, i.e. the plastic box, I would have sent the pills back. A smooth, smaller pill would certainly have been possible. Why are these flat and so large in diameter? Less flat would therefore be less diameter. Other manufacturers manage that. I will never buy them again and will soon prefer another company.\\nVery good\\nI ordered the capsules because they are important in connection with high-dose vitamin D3. The price for this amount and the good ingredients is really great, I like the large light-protected can. It is important to me that no harmful fillers are used, that is not the case here. I am very satisfied, also with the fast delivery.\\nShipping faster. Whether the product is good remains to be seen. But everything has a sound basis and seems to be worth the money.\\nThe K2 was delivered very quickly in a tinted can to protect the capsules. The capsules are normal sized and easy to swallow. I can\\'t write anything about the effect. I take the capsules to the V D3.\\nThe product arrived intact and very quickly. It makes a very good impression. I also decided to buy other products after I placed the order. Highly recommended!\\nFast delivery and good packaging. What made me buy this product - vegan and 99+% all-trans -. I am very happy with the product and the price is reasonable.\\nAll good I am very satisfied...\\nProduct is very easy to take and improves general well-being excellently. Soothes arthritic pain and harmonises digestion. Will buy it again because the price isn\\'t too bad either.\\nFast delivery. The product is characterized by a high bio availability. The price-performance ratio is right. I myself have not noticed any side effects.\\nSince I have to take vitamin D, I was looking for a product that went perfectly with it. The price-performance ratio is super cheap for this quality.\\nit\\'s all ok\\nEverything ok 👌\\nNeatly packaged, good value for money\\nFast delivery, product received as ordered. After a year of intake - in combination with a vitamin D preparation - a positive effect is clearly noticeable.\\nNow runs as a subscription\\nThese are vegan capsules without the usual additives, which was important to me and why I chose these capsules. In addition, in my opinion, the price-performance ratio is absolutely right.\\nThe quality is right here, the service and I also have the good feeling that I bought from a friendly seller 😊\\nit\\'s all ok\\nAlong with my vitamin D capsules, I take vitamin K2 every day. This company was specifically recommended to me. Will only buy these capsules in the future.\\nVery small, easy to swallow.\\nMy wife went to the endocrinologist six months ago and was diagnosed with a slight vitamin D deficiency. So I bought these pills which she took every 5 days as instructed. Now six months later, the vitamin D value was even lower. How can that be please? Placebo product without effect? Caution.\\nVery good product. These capsules are suitable for daily use and are easy and pleasant to swallow, whether you take them before or after a meal.\\nVery good combo! Without taste!\\nThank you and we will definitely order again. Everything perfect. Unfortunately it was not possible to order drops D3/K2. No idea why.\\nFast delivery, even abroad. Great value for money. I take it for better storage of calcium in the bones! I highly recommend it!\\nGreat👌\\nGreat\\nI took these pills daily as a substitute. 4 pieces, which should correspond to 20,000IE, and that over 2 weeks. Then for another week, 2 tablets a day, which should correspond to 10,000 IU. My laboratory result just came in: 20 ng/ml A value that should not occur with such a high dosage. Therefore: hands off. Despite the nice packaging and presentation, it\\'s probably something like a placebo. In addition, the tablets are very weakly pressed and already disintegrate in the mouth, especially if you take them with lukewarm liquid. Ergo: Money thrown out the window.\\nvery good\\nGreat value for money......without harmful additives.....thumbs up! I take K2 MK7 in conjunction with vitamin D3 and can be dosed super with the dose of 200 µg per capsule. Will buy again\\nI\\'ve had the capsules for a few days and I\\'m completely satisfied with them. What else is there to say? I think everyone who deals with it knows that the body needs it. Clear recommendation\\nA\\nI ordered this product for the second time to supplement with vitamin D3. I am very satisfied and convinced of the quality.\\nwon\\'t buy anything like this again!!\\nI take this K2 in addition to my D3 and tolerate it very well. I\\'m taking it for the second year now\\nThe pills themselves are very easy to swallow, but I\\'ve been taking the pills for more than 2 months, but haven\\'t had a proper comment. I am of the opinion that the tablets do not have a sufficient work level.\\nK2 brings the calcium to the places where the body needs it. K2 also has many other advantages. The dosage is also very good.\\nFast delivery\\nI have nothing negative to say about the product or the delivery. Take it together with vitamin B3 and am very satisfied. The size of the pills is also ok to swallow. Therefore full marks.\\nHighest dosage per capsule at a super price! Natural Elements is always my favorite dietary supplement because of the ingredients, because here, among other things, the controversial magnesium stearate is not used!\\nI take one capsule every day now. They are very easy to swallow. I can\\'t tell after such a short time whether they\\'re good for me.\\nUnbeatable price, plus omega 3 fatty acids 20mg from flaxseed flour, for better utilization, because v.k2 needs fat! What more could you want! will order again\\nVery satisfied👍🏻\\nTo balance my vitamin D needs\\nGood dosage, everything ok\\nproduct as described\\nHandling and simple but safe packaging\\nHello, good day, I ordered the K2 capsules to store the vitamin D3 administration in the bones. I have osteoporosis, therefore also vitamin D3. Monika wishes you a nice day.\\nThe goods were delivered very quickly and reliably. I ordered for my father, he is always satisfied with the preparation. I have already placed another order for myself. Thanks very much!\\ndosage from packaging\\nGood product, gladly again\\nI am now ordering for the second time and have already recommended the product to others and am very satisfied there too. No harmful additives - as far as I know - that was the decisive factor in my purchase.\\nI was also looking for a product that does not contain any harmful fillers or separating agents, and I found what I was looking for in this one. Couldn\\'t find any incompatibilities. I also take it in combination with vitamin D and magnesium, and feel more powerful and better with this trio than without these products. With us, the whole family is taken care of, I will buy more soon.\\nAll were as described..\\nI am very satisfied with the Vitamin K2 MK7 capsules. I chose natural elements because the capsule and the contents are totally natural. I would buy this product again and again.\\nI think value for money is great\\nYou can\\'t go wrong with this product. Of course, you also have to worry about the correct dosage and intake. Then this product will do its job. I will buy here again.\\nThese capsules were recommended to me because they are high quality and cheap at the same time. Unfortunately I can only say something about the quality after some time.\\nThank you for the good and affordable vitamin K2 preparation. It is very well tolerated and came neatly packaged and as described in no time at all. Highly recommended!!!\\ngreat\\nDelivery and product very good. Attractive price/performance ratio. Can\\'t say much about the effect yet as I\\'ve only been using the product for a few days. Very good tolerance so far. Am satisfied.\\nI am so happy to have finally found a K2 that is free of all the artificial additives - at a really good price. Many thanks to the manufacturer keep it up.\\nI take these vitamins so that taking vitamin D doesn\\'t have any unwanted side effects. I get less sun in the winter, so I take both vitamins to compensate for the lack of calcium.\\nThe addition of vitamin K2 is very important in a vegan diet. It\\'s a large pack, lasts a year. Arrived on time. I will recommend the company.\\nI\\'ve been taking vitamin K2 for about 3 years and it has helped me a lot with a circulatory disorder. I wanted K2 from a new company with fewer additives and found K2 here.\\n... at an extremely reasonable price. Don\\'t know of anything comparable at the moment. I will certainly buy again and again (not only for myself), as long as there are no doubts that the content and its shelf life correspond to the declaration. My favorite.\\nit\\'s all ok\\nDietary supplements that have been tested in Germany are rare and the capsules only contain the effective isomer of vitamin K2, so I\\'m happy to add something.\\nI take it very well. I also recommended this product to a friend. She also tolerates this well. It\\'s really difficult to write about an effect, I haven\\'t taken it long enough for that.\\nUnfortunately I had to return the order because I wasn\\'t paying attention myself and had ordered something wrong. The return took place without any problems. Customer service very, very friendly and reliable.\\nBecause me and my wife each bought 365 capsules last year, took them and were very satisfied, we have now ordered two bottles again. We recommend them\\nSuper fast delivery, everything perfect. I\\'ve just started taking it, so I can\\'t say anything else yet.\\nThe dietary supplement from this company was recommended to me and I am very satisfied. I also find it positive that it is clearly marked which form of K2 it is.\\nI am very satisfied with the product! Take it at the same time as vitamin D3. It\\'s vegan, the capsules are quite large, but I have no problem swallowing large capsules. Again and again. Top!\\nGood performance\\nAgain and again !\\nI am very happy with the product, a good quantity at a fair price. But most importantly, it does not contain any additives such as magnesium stearate/dioxin.I can warmly recommend the manufacturer 5stars!!\\nI am happy\\nAm satisfied!\\nI bought the product because it is cheap and has no harmful additives. I\\'m very happy with it and haven\\'t noticed anything negative so far.\\nI think I bought a very good product. I think it\\'s great that there are no other fillers. Take it in combination with Sango Coral and Vit.D\\nPrice 👍 I can\\'t say anything about the effect yet, maybe in half a year - after my next examination.\\nThanks to Prime, it got to me quickly. The capsules are easy to swallow. The quantity and size are ideal. The capsules have a shelf life of 2 years. Content lasts for one year. Unlike other cheap suppliers, the capsules are stored in dark packaging and are protected from the sun\\'s rays. Will get it again.\\nThe goods were delivered promptly and the quality is also great. We can only recommend it. We feel much more comfortable with K2 from natural elements.\\nMy neighbor accepted the goods\\nEverything fine and wonderful!\\nI take the product in combination with vitamin D.

Gladly again\\nI\\'m positive :))\\nThe product does not have any negative properties so far and the price is also okay. If anything changes, I will try to revise my review.\\nInstead of pharmaceuticals\\nAs a supplement to taking vitamin D. Unbeatable price for the quality offered, always happy.\\nFast delivery as expected. I bought this product because it is purely made up of additives. This is something you should bear in mind, especially nowadays.\\nAttractively priced and without harmful additives (such as fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, etc.). I had previously taken the SuperK from LifeExtensions (much more expensive with the same vitamin K2 MK7 dosage).\\ngreat\\nVery good products.\\nI can\\'t say anything about the effect yet. The delivery was quick and the can was sealed. It also doesn\\'t smell like fish, as some here claim. I would buy it again anytime.\\nThe K2 is soaked on flax seeds giving an extra bit of omega 3 fatty acids\\nI take high doses of Vit D and K2 MK7 is definitely one of them. This is usually very expensive. This product is priced more moderately and the components are ok as far as I can tell.\\nThe price-performance ratio is definitely right. Unfortunately, I can\\'t say anything about the effect of the product yet. Since it is a natural product, you should be patient.\\nWe have been taking this K2 for several months and have tolerated it well.\\ncapsules ok Income 0k. I\\'ve been taking it for a year. Everything OK.\\nMy mother has been taking it for a few months now and is very happy with it.\\nI chose this product because it contains no additives and is produced in Germany, all trans was of course also important.\\nGreat product👍 Ideal in combination with vitamin D3.

Very good value for money. Clear purchase recommendation!\\nEverything great!\\nI chose this product because I liked the natural ingredients.

All the best for your company.\\nI am very pleased. Everything went well with the delivery. Value for money is also good. The amount is great because I\\'ve been taken care of for a whole year now!\\nEverything great👍\\nThe K2 value at this dose is far too low and is only 100ug - it should contain at least 150-200ug. On vitamind.de and other sites you can read that lower values \\u200b\\u200bcould also be harmful to health.\\nGood product.\\nCombined with magnesium, vitamin K 2 and vitamin D 3 - this combination serves to prevent osteoporosis\\nI\\'ve only been taking it for 5 days and haven\\'t noticed anything negative yet.\\nI have tried several products and will use these in the future.

I can only recommend to everyone.\\nI appreciate the product very much.Like all german products this is also excellent .Thank you!\\nWhat a lot of people don\\'t know: You need vitamin K2 so that your body can absorb high-dose vitamin D3 at all. Since I take MTX and shouldn\\'t go out in the sun, both products still help me to live just as healthy as someone else who gets their D3 from the sun every day ...Price performance is great.\\nShould probably be the price-performance winner in the segment of vitamin K2 products at the moment. No stearate/silicon in it, just natural ingredients as far as you can tell. That\\'s how we like it :-)\\nI\\'ve gotten along great with it since I took it with my D3. I am very satisfied with the products from Natural Elements.\\nPrompt delivery with a very good price-performance ratio.

Fast delivery, good packaging and the best thing for me: no artificial additives. Country of manufacture = Germany 👍🏻\\nGood product. I came across the product by accident and after almost 4 weeks I feel much better than before. Top\\nThe nice thing is that I\\'ve been supplied with K2 for a long time now. I take it with my D3 drops so D3 gets where it belongs.\\nVery good vitamin K2, mainly because it comes only from natural sources and is without any additives. That\\'s how it should be if you\\'re looking for good NEM\\'s.\\nYour goods are perfect. Easy to take and without side effects. After a short time, eight days, a positive effect can already be seen.\\nA great product from Germany and also vegan. What more do you want? I would recommend it to anyone interested in this vitamin.\\nOnly half the content for the same price. That\\'s what I call profit maximization.

I tolerate the capsules without any problems and the price-performance ratio is okay.\\nthey don\\'t have a smooth surface and are difficult to get down and they have no oil, vitamin d3 is fat-soluble, so you have to choke them down to eat. never again. will all take the drops again\\nI think it\\'s great that the products are tested in the laboratory so that the buyer can understand what he is buying. Keep it up.\\nGood products are good - reviews just need rubbish...although I would prefer the stuff without the pointless capsules; and as the lord of the dose.\\nTop\\nI ordered this product for the first time and would be happy if it met my expectations. Value for money is good.\\nProduct from Germany without additives... that was important to me! Super fast shipping! I am 100% satisfied and can only recommend Natural Elements\\nWhy such a huge container? A catastrophe from an ecological point of view, especially since plastic waste is accumulating again. The screw cap couldn\\'t even be opened with a pipe wrench, so we had to forcefully destroy the packaging. Something like that doesn\\'t work at all.\\nfast delivery; Whether K2 will do what is promised remains to be seen, we hope\\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend this product. Have now taken it 3x and 3x after that I got cardiac arrhythmias, anxiety and headaches for 3-4 days. 3 earnings because at first I thought the conditions were coming from something else. However, I can recommend other products from this company.\\nEverything great\\nWonderful quick processing - I will test the product now and hope that after a while I will feel an improvement in my symptoms.
